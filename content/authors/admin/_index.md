Shital Shah currently works as Principal Research Engineer at Microsoft Research with interests in deep learning and reinforcement learning. His previous works includes co-authoring a distributed machine-learned clustering system for web-scale data that powered parts of Bing and co-founding the team. In 2017, he authored [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/airsim), a physically and visually realistic cross-platform simulator for AI research. In 2018, he authored [TensorWatch](http://tensorwatch.org), a new approach for debugging and visualizing machine learning. More recently he co-authored [Archai][https://github.com/microsoft/archai], a platform for Neural Architecture Search that has yielded the models powering text completition feature in Microsoft Office. Currently, he is working on math and code generation models with goal towards achieving perfect reasoning.
