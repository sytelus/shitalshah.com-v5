Well, bad news. Weather isn’t looking good for [tomorrow’s historic event][1].

It’s like 80% chance of showers almost entire Pacific Northwest extending even in to Eastern Washington. Even [LIGO Observatory][2] is not going to have sun shine. But if

you believe that a hole in the sky might appear just to take pick then there are [several events

lined up for public viewing][3] with free entry and no registration. Public events are much safer way to view Venus Transit

because they would have appropriate solar filters and/or projection boards. Some might even have live webcasts. If that much

anticipated hole in the sky does not appear then here are the options for online viewing:

* [NASA Live Webscast][4]
* [Slooh Venus Transit Event][5]
* [Live from Mauna Loa, HI][6]
* [Mount Wilson Observatory webcast][7]
* […and other places][8]

It would be also good time to brush up on [Venus peculiarities][9] and

[some historical

context][10].
