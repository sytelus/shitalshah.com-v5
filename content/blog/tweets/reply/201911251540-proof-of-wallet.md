[@rbhar90](https://x.com/rbhar90) You might be bit over-enthusiastic here. Proof of work-makes things inefficient and long term unsustainable. Add consensus requirement and they can be hijacked by big players. It's like a democracy where everyone gets vote for a dollar. Top 1%er will eventually wipe out the rest.
