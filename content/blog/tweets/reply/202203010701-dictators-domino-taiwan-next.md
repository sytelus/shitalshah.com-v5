[@tomlebree](https://x.com/tomlebree) [@RuneLinding](https://x.com/RuneLinding) The consequences are far more dire than EU turning into clown. It will be permission to all dictatorial nuclear powers to attack countries that they have been wanting for long time. I would expect next casualty to be Taiwan.
