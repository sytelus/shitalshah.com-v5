[@andthedropout](https://x.com/andthedropout) [@m_a_schenk](https://x.com/m_a_schenk) [@ggerganov](https://x.com/ggerganov) StableDiffusion release was absolutely game changer. Community rushed into make models order of magnitude faster and smaller. Many fine tuned cases like logo/Manga generation. Improvements in image editing and retouching. All within just 3-4 months!

We are seeing same for LLaMA.
