[@phil_bennett](https://x.com/phil_bennett) [@ctrlshifti](https://x.com/ctrlshifti) Nurse, teachers, EMTs get severally underpaid. I think there is a problem of distribution from the top. Hospitals/universities charges astronomical amounts but very little flows to people on the floor. For software world, this problem is less severe, probably due to demand/supply
