[@IntuitMachine](https://x.com/IntuitMachine) [@dmonett](https://x.com/dmonett) [@markburgess_osl](https://x.com/markburgess_osl) [@OpenAI](https://x.com/OpenAI) MCTS is powerful tool indeed. I think many of us are more obsessed towards purely learned approaches with hope that they are more adaptive/longer term robust over diverse problems. It may not be good obsession. MCTC/other tools might indeed turn out to be essential primitives.
