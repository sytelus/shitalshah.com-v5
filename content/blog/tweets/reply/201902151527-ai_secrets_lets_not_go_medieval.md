[@dennybritz](https://x.com/dennybritz) [@jackclarkSF](https://x.com/jackclarkSF) [@catherineols](https://x.com/catherineols) [@deliprao](https://x.com/deliprao) So what do you suggest? AI research be done in secrecy, keep progress private? AI is unlike nuclear tech - anyone can do it. GPT-2 potentially be trained on OpenCrawl on AWS within personal budget. Knowledge+sharing is essential to build defences or we are back to medieval times.
