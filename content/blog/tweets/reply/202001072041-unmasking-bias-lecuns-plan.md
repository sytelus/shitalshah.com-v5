[@rasbt](https://x.com/rasbt) [@roydanroy](https://x.com/roydanroy) [@ylecun](https://x.com/ylecun) Few problems with his proposal:
1. Authors are not anonymous, bias *will* creep in.
2. No obligation for REs to review anything.
3. Less conventional ideas may get even lesser REs to avoid impact on their score.
4. Prestigious REs can get unevenly swamped and the Matthew effect.
