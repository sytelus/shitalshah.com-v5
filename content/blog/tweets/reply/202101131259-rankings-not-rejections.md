[@jbhuang0604](https://x.com/jbhuang0604) Conferences should assign ranking and people can chose to attend top N presentations. There is no need for binary “accept” and “reject”. For employment purposes, employer can look at ranking as one of the comparison and reward better quality works (as determined by peers).
