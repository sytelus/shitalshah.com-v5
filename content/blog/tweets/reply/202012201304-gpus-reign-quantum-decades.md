[@Plinz](https://x.com/Plinz) [@dmonett](https://x.com/dmonett) Even if Huangâ€™s law holds over next 10yr, we still remain fairly far away from hardware requirements. I have heard no one in QC land or other exotic areas claim big enough leaps coming in next 10yr to unsit GPUs. All these might happen but more likely horizon seems to be 30-40yr.
