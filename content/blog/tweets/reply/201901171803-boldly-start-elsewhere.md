[@AndreaWiggins](https://x.com/AndreaWiggins) Starting with first episodes of Star Trek series is probably a mistake. It takes time to settle in, refine and suddenly it enormously gets better than almost anything else. So pick random ep and enjoy. For DS9, I would avoid few last episodes, however. They are true disaster.
