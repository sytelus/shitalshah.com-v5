Optimizing anything differentiable is actually very hard. It’s easy to forget about dozens of techniques we have accumulated for “simple” case of neural network (norms, residual, dropout, LR schedules, warmup etc) over a decade and even get them going at scale is pretty hard.… [continue reading](https://x.com/sytelus/status/1647380599462678531)
