[@PrescientTrade](https://x.com/PrescientTrade) [@zerohedge](https://x.com/zerohedge) Itâ€™s very easy in fact. They just sign in a law that it is illegal to buy, sell or own BTC for any US based entity. Coinbase, Cashapp etc will be required to seize the operation within 30 days. This is actually the case in India. All funds will be required to immediately divest.
