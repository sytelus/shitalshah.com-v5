[@Austen](https://x.com/Austen) At $30/hr and class of 10, the cost of a teacher is $480/student/mo. Add facilities, admin etc, cost is ~$1000/student/mo. A private school in areas with bad public schools but cheaper houses are huge opportunity. People are paying for good public schools via much higher mortgage
