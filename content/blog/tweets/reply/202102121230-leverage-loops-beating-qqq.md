[@LAshowkatian](https://x.com/LAshowkatian) One reason could be leverage. You are doing, say, 15% cash flow on investment. Your assets meanwhile also rises to 15% which allows you to take out more loans and then buy more assets. I think if you recursively keep doing it and not mess up then you can beat $QQQ over long term.
