[@suchisaria](https://x.com/suchisaria) [@Miles_Brundage](https://x.com/Miles_Brundage) [@tdietterich](https://x.com/tdietterich) [@timnitGebru](https://x.com/timnitGebru) [@chrshmmmr](https://x.com/chrshmmmr) [@Ismail_Elezi](https://x.com/Ismail_Elezi) [@Google](https://x.com/Google) PageRank would solve many of the problems cited here. It was invented for precisely to solve these problems in academic citations by Google founders. It's damn mystery to me why Google Scholar itself refused to use it side-by-side for h-index.
