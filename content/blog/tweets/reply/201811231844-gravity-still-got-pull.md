[@patrickc](https://x.com/patrickc) Most will consider Newton’s theory of gravity more important  than Eisenstein’s GR. It doesn’t imply diminishing value of GR. Yes, new discoveries will always be harder but with exponentially increased population, the higher impact of new discovery compensates for increased cost.
