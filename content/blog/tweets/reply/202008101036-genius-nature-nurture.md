[@sarahookr](https://x.com/sarahookr) Your confidence is admirable but there is no scientific evidence of how genetics impacts “brilliantness”. For many people you mention, major impacts had been just one or two and even for those there had been a lot of luck involved like access to right grad students or colleagues.
