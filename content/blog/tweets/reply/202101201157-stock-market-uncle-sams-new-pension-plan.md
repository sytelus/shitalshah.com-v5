[@Jordy__Long](https://x.com/Jordy__Long) Everyone’s 401k is tied up with stock market. People will hold government accountable for keeping market stable regardless of fundamentals. A drop more than 20% will require govt to step in or lose the vote in elections. Stock market is new “federal pension administration”.
