[@ryanonsrc](https://x.com/ryanonsrc) [@xamat](https://x.com/xamat) [@StephenPiment](https://x.com/StephenPiment) How about focusing on _what_ you speak/write about? I do get turned off by speaker, blogger, strategist, executive, founder,  expert, leader (or worse “thought leader”) descriptors especially when actual subject of expertise is omitted/deemphasized. I think author is fine though.
