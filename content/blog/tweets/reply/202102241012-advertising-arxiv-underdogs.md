[@danintheory](https://x.com/danintheory) I would argue deep pocketed entities already have huge following so gain for them are marginal.  It even small scale advertising should help relatively unknown entities far more. They are at severe advantage and I feel we shouldnâ€™t be disgusted for promoting free arxiv links.
