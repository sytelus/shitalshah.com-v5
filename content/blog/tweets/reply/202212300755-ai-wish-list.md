[@DrJimFan](https://x.com/DrJimFan) [@waitbutwhy](https://x.com/waitbutwhy) [@sama](https://x.com/sama) This is exactly when AI can make new scientific discoveries. Imagine engineering molecules of desired properties like transparency, conductivity, strength, melting point. Imagine new vaccines, engineered bacterias, efficient fusion, creating wormholes, robots rebuilding planets!
