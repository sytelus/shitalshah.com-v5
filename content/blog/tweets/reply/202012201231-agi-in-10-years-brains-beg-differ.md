[@dmonett](https://x.com/dmonett) Few arguments against AGI in 10 years: First, assuming evolution is reasonably thrifty, human-level cognition might requires number of synapses that currently will take entire data center to fit. Given Moors law is dead + brain needs only 10W, we are far away from hardware side.
