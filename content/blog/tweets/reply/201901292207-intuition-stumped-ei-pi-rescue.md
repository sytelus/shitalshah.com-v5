[@gwern](https://x.com/gwern) 2/ The problem is that empiricism and intuition aren't very compositional. They take you only so far. With math you can manipulate symbols and relations to mechanically arrive at fact that you probably couldn't with just intuition or experiments. Classic example: e^(i * pi) = -1
