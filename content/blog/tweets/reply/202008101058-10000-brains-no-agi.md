[@ericjang11](https://x.com/ericjang11) There are 10^14 synapses in brain. Assuming 1 transistor/synapse, we produce enough transistors globally/yr ~ to 10,000 brains. We are as unfortunate generation as many before us which simply doesnâ€™t have enough compute to achieve AGI. We can see the light but tunnel is too long.
