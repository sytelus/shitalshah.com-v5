[@sherjilozair](https://x.com/sherjilozair) [@attharave](https://x.com/attharave) [@yacineMTB](https://x.com/yacineMTB) This is not true. I can give you a huge list of tweets with great papers and still got ~0 attention. Most researchers have small followings. Their tweets get noticed by few if at all. Top 1% of accounts gets 99% of attention regardless relative usefulness of their content.
