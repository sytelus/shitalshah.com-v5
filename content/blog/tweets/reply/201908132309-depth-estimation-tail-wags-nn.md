[@csakon](https://x.com/csakon) [@scale_AI](https://x.com/scale_AI) Depth estimation is critical for obstacle avoidance + planning. Animals are good at it not only because eye qualities like high dynamic range, maintaining world state and using relative poses of recognized objects. Its long tail problem and NNs have solved very small part of it.
