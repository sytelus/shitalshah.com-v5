[@ipeirotis](https://x.com/ipeirotis) [@johnjhorton](https://x.com/johnjhorton) Per Forbs, a meat-loaded pizza costs $1.90 to make and sells for $14 (636% markup). The 24x7 pizza vending machines in offices, airports, malls have potential. Another huge missed business opportunities is fresh coffee vending machines. Great coffee should not cost more than $1.
