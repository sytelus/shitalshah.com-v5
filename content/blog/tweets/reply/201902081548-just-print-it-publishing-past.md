[@SussilloDavid](https://x.com/SussilloDavid) [@arokem](https://x.com/arokem) [@mschilli1](https://x.com/mschilli1) To be fair, publishing wasnâ€™t big deal as it is now. Very few journals, mostly European and no one worried about citations. Of course no h-index. If editors have space and feels good, they just print it. Few researchers, few venues, few positions. Easy to hire in industrial labs.
