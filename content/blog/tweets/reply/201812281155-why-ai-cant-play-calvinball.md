[@Grady_Booch](https://x.com/Grady_Booch) One thing enabled by "understanding" is ability to do arbitrary counterfactuals. For ex, when playing with kids, in mid game we can device new arbitrary rule, agree that its fair and continue with the game. Every current algorithm will break needing re-training if this happened.
