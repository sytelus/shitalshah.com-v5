[@Alessan71025006](https://x.com/Alessan71025006) [@NicolaManzini](https://x.com/NicolaManzini) [@paulg](https://x.com/paulg) [@01Core_Ben](https://x.com/01Core_Ben) Itâ€™s actually worse. Fictions like Harry Potter, Lord of the ring etc are built on idea that there is only one dude who can save the world and the reason for this is that he was just born that way. Reader is pulled into identifying with this hero to feel being special.
