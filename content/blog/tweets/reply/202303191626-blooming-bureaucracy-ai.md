[@EMostaque](https://x.com/EMostaque) [@peterpull6](https://x.com/peterpull6) [@OpenAI](https://x.com/OpenAI) BLOOM 176B model was entirely trained at GENCY through French government grant. They get to use about 400 A100s for 4 months. The problem is you need connections and patience. And committees tend to screw things up like they did in BLOOM.
