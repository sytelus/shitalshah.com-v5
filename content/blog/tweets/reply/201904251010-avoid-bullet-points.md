[@AcademicChatter](https://x.com/AcademicChatter) * avoid bullet points
* put human faces, your surroundings, your users
* take opportunity to be informal, tell story about genesis, how sausage was made
* avoid irrelevant stock photos
* add short videos, keep them embedded, auto-play
* include how you can use this, code snippets
