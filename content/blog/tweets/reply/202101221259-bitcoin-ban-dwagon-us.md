[@PrescientTrade](https://x.com/PrescientTrade) [@zerohedge](https://x.com/zerohedge) Bitcoin is already banned in China, India and several other countries. Countries needs to own currencies to stay financially functional which is why foreign tenders are prohibited to buy/sell goods. I fully expect BTC to become illegal in US when it starts to threaten dollar.
