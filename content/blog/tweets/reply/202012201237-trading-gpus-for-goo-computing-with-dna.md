[@dmonett](https://x.com/dmonett) My guess is that we need new kind of computing devices, far more efficient that GPUs. Perhaps truly understand bio cells as computer, DNA as program and build upon hard work evolution has already done. We might be species who engineers next bump in evolution but not in 10yr.
