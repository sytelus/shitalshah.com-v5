[@vmbrasseur](https://x.com/vmbrasseur) I prefer the model where each speaker gets only 5 minutes for their talk. After all speakers have chance, audience votes on which speaker should get 15 more minutes. Any additional time then can be utilized as poster session where members of audience talk to desired speakers 1:1.
