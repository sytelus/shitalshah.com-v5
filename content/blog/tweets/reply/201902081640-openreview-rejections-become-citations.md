[@abhshkdz](https://x.com/abhshkdz) Why not openreview? (1) authors have incentive to put good work because rejections are public and searchable (2) wrong rejections stays available and may even accumulate citations! 

Any barriers to entry, monetary or otherwise, is probably bad for at least some segments.
