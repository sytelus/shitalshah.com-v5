[@chr1sa](https://x.com/chr1sa) People buy products, not parts. Unfortunately 3D printers havenâ€™t advanced to print useful day to day products. Also, not to mention vast majority of them will put enough micro particles in air that it would have been a major health issue if they were actually ubiquitous.
