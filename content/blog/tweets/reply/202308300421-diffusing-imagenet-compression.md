This is often asked question: <https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/qiXs9bEuT2iTYTF2f/the-surprising-parameter-efficiency-of-vision-models>

My analysis:

ImageNet classification problems achieves ~1:2500 compression for parameters to training data size. However, this is task specialized model so it's not same.   However, diffusion models seems to achieveâ€¦ [continue reading](https://x.com/sytelus/status/1696634125803982963)
