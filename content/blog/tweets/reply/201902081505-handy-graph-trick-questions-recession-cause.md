[@paulg](https://x.com/paulg) [@DKThomp](https://x.com/DKThomp) [@adam_tooze](https://x.com/adam_tooze) [@NickSzabo4](https://x.com/NickSzabo4) [@ATabarrok](https://x.com/ATabarrok) It is striking that if you cover up post-2007 portion of this graph with your hand, you will see that the cross over would have still happened even without recession. That creates a question if the recession was the effect rather than the cause.
