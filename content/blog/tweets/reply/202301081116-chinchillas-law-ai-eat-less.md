[@srchvrs](https://x.com/srchvrs) [@francoisfleuret](https://x.com/francoisfleuret) Current models seem larger than they should be because they train on large datasets. The gold standard probably is amount of data an average blind human would encounter for 18 years of life. Number of params corresponding to that dataset size should be much less per Chinchilla.
