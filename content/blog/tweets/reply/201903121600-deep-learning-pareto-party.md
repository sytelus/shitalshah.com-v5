[@imleslahdin](https://x.com/imleslahdin) 52.4% of accepted NeurIPS papers comes from just 10 institutes. Numbers are similar for ICML. If you list down top 10 most important innovations in deep learning, they would show the same pattern as well. Innovations in deep learning so far had been following Pareto distribution.
