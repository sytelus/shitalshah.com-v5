[@khaledealy](https://x.com/khaledealy) [@paulg](https://x.com/paulg) [@Suhail](https://x.com/Suhail) To be contrarian, startup is burning investor money, donâ€™t care about revenues, failures are norm. Big company must  reliably bring in money to pay bills, catastrophic failures are not an option, on closure 1000s of families will be displaced. We should appreciate both worlds :).
