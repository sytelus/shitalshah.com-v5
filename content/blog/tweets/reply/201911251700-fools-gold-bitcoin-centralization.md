[@ani_pai](https://x.com/ani_pai) PoW is not new. The oldest PoW implementation is money backed by gold. It never solved centralization issue. If everyone gives away 20% of their PoW to govt, that entity will eventually have enough resources to own majority PoW production. Gold or bitcoin don't make a difference.
