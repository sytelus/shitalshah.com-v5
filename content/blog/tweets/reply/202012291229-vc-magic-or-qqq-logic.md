[@RonConway](https://x.com/RonConway) Top quartile VC funds have returns 15%-27%. Return of $QQQ ETF is 20%. So why not just dump money in QQQ? Much more safer and effectively backed by US govt (expect feds to step in if more than 20% drop!). I think fallacy is thinking somehow VCs have magical returns. Most donâ€™t.
