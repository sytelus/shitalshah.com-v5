[@K2_181](https://x.com/K2_181) [@paulg](https://x.com/paulg) You are probably talking about this: <https://www.slideshare.net/mobile/kloeckner/kauffman-foundationventurecapital>. But isnâ€™t this pretty outdated in context of YC-like model that has largely changed the game (i.e. very founder friendly, large batches, low seed)? Many VCs are doing pretty good wrt S&amp;P500 with new models vs 1990s.
