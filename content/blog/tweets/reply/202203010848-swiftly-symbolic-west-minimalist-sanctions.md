[@Raamana_](https://x.com/Raamana_) [@DAlperovitch](https://x.com/DAlperovitch) This is not true. All SWIFT restrictions are against select banks such that it causes minimal disruption to business with West. That means they are again largely symbolic. As I said before, West has no tolerance for financial losses when their economies are already in bad shape.
