[@rasbt](https://x.com/rasbt) [@roydanroy](https://x.com/roydanroy) [@ylecun](https://x.com/ylecun) With this in mind, I would propose followings to [@ylecun](https://x.com/ylecun)'s proposal: 
1. The system requires REs to review N papers/year.
2. The authors+reviewers are anonymous.
3. REs are autonomously and randomly selected from the matching pool normalized on their credit score distribution.
