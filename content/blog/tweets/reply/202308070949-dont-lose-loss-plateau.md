[@tomgoldsteincs](https://x.com/tomgoldsteincs) You can keep running and loss will plateau eventually. The thing is that if you *then* decrease LR then loss again starts decreasing! So, every time loss plateaus, you can keep decreasing LR but thatâ€™s overall less efficient than reducing LR on a schedule.
