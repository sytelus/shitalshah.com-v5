[@Raamana_](https://x.com/Raamana_) [@DAlperovitch](https://x.com/DAlperovitch) I am indeed not an expert on these matters. As far as I understand, sanctions due to Crimea were mainly a gesture and did not do any harm. Russia has continued most business as usual, did new massive energy projects in EU and built bigger than ever financial war chest since then.
