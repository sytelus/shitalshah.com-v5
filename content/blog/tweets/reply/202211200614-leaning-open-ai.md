[@ykilcher](https://x.com/ykilcher) [@ayyar](https://x.com/ayyar) Just to be clear I donâ€™t have strong position either side of this debate. I was just pointing out good argument on one side. AI research has greatly benefited by opening things up to the community so I do lean on that side but I am not an expert on this subject.
