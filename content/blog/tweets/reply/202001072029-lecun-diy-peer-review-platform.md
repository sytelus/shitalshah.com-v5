[@rasbt](https://x.com/rasbt) [@roydanroy](https://x.com/roydanroy) [@ylecun](https://x.com/ylecun) had a great proposal for this: A public repository where anyone can post papers as and when they are ready, invite self-organized review committees of their choice, reviewers share citation graphs and get credit. <http://yann.lecun.com/ex/pamphlets/publishing-models.html>
