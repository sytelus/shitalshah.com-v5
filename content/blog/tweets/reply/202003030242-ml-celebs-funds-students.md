[@thegautamkamath](https://x.com/thegautamkamath) It has perhaps less to do with theory/empirical nature and more with funding for so many students falling from sky if you are even moderate level ML celebrity. I can imagine it would be hard to say no to all that money even though effort to groom per student is unchanged.
