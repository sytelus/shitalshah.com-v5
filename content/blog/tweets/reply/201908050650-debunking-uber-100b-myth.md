[@forEmil](https://x.com/forEmil) [@fchollet](https://x.com/fchollet) $100B is very likely wrong number. Hope you are being careful because this kind of tweets can spreads misinformation. Uber has been spending on avg quarter billion per year while Waymo had been spending even less: <https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2017/09/15/at-1-1-billion-googles-self-driving-car-moonshot-looks-like-a-bargain/#3dd9de1257bb>
