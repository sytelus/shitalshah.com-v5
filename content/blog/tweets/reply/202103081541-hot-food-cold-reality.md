[@lpolovets](https://x.com/lpolovets) [@eatfamiliar](https://x.com/eatfamiliar) I want to understand how is this possible, at least in US. Typical delivery takes more than 20 mins one way. Assuming minimum wages, this adds on $10 cost plus other charges would pull this up to $20. Most likely delivery takes an hour one way. How do you even keep food hot?
