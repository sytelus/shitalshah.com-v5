[@3Aleph](https://x.com/3Aleph) [@SamoBurja](https://x.com/SamoBurja) You donâ€™t need to always do buybacks etc. Get in tech company like Evernote, fire everyone other than ops staff and keep collecting existing revenue. No vision, new features, bug fixes, new customers but that fine because you will milk a lot of money before cow eventually dies.
