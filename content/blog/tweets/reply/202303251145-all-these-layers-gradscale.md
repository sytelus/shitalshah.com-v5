[@douglasahorr](https://x.com/douglasahorr) [@graphcoreai](https://x.com/graphcoreai) This looks like a great work! However, looking at notebook it seems you need to modify all layers you are using? Could there be a more simpler approach like GradScaler that I can quickly implement and test it? Also, does this method work with FlashAttention?
