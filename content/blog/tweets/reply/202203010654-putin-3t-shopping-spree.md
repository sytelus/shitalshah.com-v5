[@Raamana_](https://x.com/Raamana_) [@DAlperovitch](https://x.com/DAlperovitch) Ukraineâ€™s GDP is $50B. At 20X multiple, Ukrain is financially worth $3T. Sanctions are still mainly symbolic with cost in noise against these numbers. To Putin, this is financially a massive net gain and no-brainer. Social media will move on in short time like they did in Crimea.
