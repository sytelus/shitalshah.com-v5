[@chr1sa](https://x.com/chr1sa) [@Jason](https://x.com/Jason) I'm sad to see entire generation growing up on watered down locked up devices built for consumption. There writing docs is main "creative" act, JavaScript is the lowest level language. I want my kids to know about file/threads, have machines that allows them to write their own OS
