[@PreetumNakkiran](https://x.com/PreetumNakkiran) [@BlinkDL_AI](https://x.com/BlinkDL_AI) I had seen this before and very confused by lofty claims and screenshots but a lack of cohesive paper, systematic approach and a proper table of metrics on standard benchmarks. Do you follow what exactly has been done there and/or verified the ambiguous claims?
