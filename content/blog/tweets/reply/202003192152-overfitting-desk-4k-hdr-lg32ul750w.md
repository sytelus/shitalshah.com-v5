[@UPLIFTDesk](https://x.com/UPLIFTDesk) It would be good to get 4K with HDR and P3 color gamute such as LG 32UL750-W. You won’t go back to regular ones after this :). Two of these are awesome and 3 would almost overfit 72x30” desk space. I would have liked OLED but Alienware 55” is only option which is very expensive.
