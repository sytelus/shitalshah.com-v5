[@SusanGroff1](https://x.com/SusanGroff1) [@xEleutherophobe](https://x.com/xEleutherophobe) [@zachweinberg](https://x.com/zachweinberg) Money math: Assume class of 16 students. You need 2.5 teachers/yr. That’s $250K/yr or $15600/student each year. This is not including facilities, security, administrative, materials etc fees. So private schools are expensive for a reason and public schools aren’t going to go away
