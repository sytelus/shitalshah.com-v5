[@avneeshsays](https://x.com/avneeshsays) These lists are mostly populated by buddies pulling favor. This is why inclusion in this list is a signal that most of these people in list will fail in medium/long term as they usually didnâ€™t got there on merit. You can backtest past lists to see failure rates.
