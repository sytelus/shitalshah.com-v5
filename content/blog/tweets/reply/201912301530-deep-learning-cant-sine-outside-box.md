[@LeCun](https://x.com/LeCun) You can find many examples from the fact DL (and much of ML) fails miserably at extrapolation. For example, get as much data as you want for sine function in any desired range. A model would do great within that range but fail miserably outside. Most humans won't fail similarly.
