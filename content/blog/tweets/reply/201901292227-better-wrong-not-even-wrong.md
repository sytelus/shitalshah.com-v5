[@gwern](https://x.com/gwern) 7/ In science, you are allowed to be wrong but you are not allowed make assertions that are not falsifiable. Pauli called later types "not even wrong". Proving existing theories wrong is scientific progress. In physics virtually no theory has proven to be 100% right, GR/QM incl.
