[@srchvrs](https://x.com/srchvrs) [@OpenAI](https://x.com/OpenAI) [@KyleCranmer](https://x.com/KyleCranmer) Itâ€™s appeal to extreme but not fallacy :). When papers has 1000+ people, it becomes very difficult to exclude someone. So CERN has policy of adding everyone who has affiliation. Given that, the citation amounts to nothing more than confirmation of your employment.
