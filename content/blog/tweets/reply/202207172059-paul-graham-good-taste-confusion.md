[@togelius](https://x.com/togelius) [@paulg](https://x.com/paulg) [@paulg](https://x.com/paulg) wrote essay if Good taste exist. IMO, he seem to confuse mastery of skills with “good taste”. Experience/skill (eg painting) arguably allows for more refined taste in that domain. Adjusting for skill levels, examples in his essay suggests exact reverse of his conclusion.
