[@togelius](https://x.com/togelius) [@paulg](https://x.com/paulg) It took me a while to realize that this class of tests are utterly pointless. I can create solid logistical argument for each of the answers to be perfectly legitimate and the test only measures failure to read one specific test setter’s mind, aka agreement with the “authority”.
