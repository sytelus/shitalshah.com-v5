[@miweru](https://x.com/miweru) There is nothing wrong with VC getting 100X return. They lose money on
most bets. You can't expect someone to throw money at ideas that has 10% chance of success for max 20% returns. Philanthropy has limited scale. Many VCs do pretty bad overall even with occasional 100X returns.
