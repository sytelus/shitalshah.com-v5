[@chr1sa](https://x.com/chr1sa) [@Jason](https://x.com/Jason) My test for calling a computer "general purpose" is simple: Can you build your own OS for that machine using that machine without losing your warranty? If you can't then you didn't bought general purpose computer, you bought a consumption device that has a computer.
