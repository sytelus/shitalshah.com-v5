[@vlordier](https://x.com/vlordier) [@ayyar](https://x.com/ayyar) As I understand the criticism, itâ€™s not about getting fake papers published but rather they getting used by bad actors as expert viewpoint and scientific evidence for their arguments. Currently effort of writing elaborate very convincing paper is non-trivial which now ~0.
