[@stephenroller](https://x.com/stephenroller) [@srush_nlp](https://x.com/srush_nlp) For smaller models, seq len has huge impact on flops but for large models d_model overshadows everything else because it must be scaled as well. However, it remains to be seen if longer seq len is proportionally beneficial to smaller models.
