Maryam Mirzakhani, a first female Field Medal winner was Iranian. Once she won infinite dollars in a math challenge. She used to draw so many math figures that her daughter thought she was an artist. When she died her relatives cannot visit because of travel ban for Iran. 1/n

I have now known people who can't leave US to see their parents because of travel ban, brilliant students who can't study abroad, students who can't get internship because of their country. This is infuriating at so many levels, so utterly unamerican. No one should stand for this
