Super impressive and an important milestone in AI today! The MT-DNN developed at our own MSR AI team now has achieved human level performance in many natural language understanding tasks!! 1/n
<https://gluebenchmark.com/leaderboard/>

This is a significant jump in performance from what was previously possible from OpenAI’s GPT-2 and Google AI’s BERT based models on some of the very challenging tasks that also requires demonstration of common sense reasoning. 2/n

I highly doubt if any of these models are actually doing human-like reasoning but still achieving human-level performance on these tasks nonetheless had been one of the long held dream. Heartily congratulations to the team! 3/n
