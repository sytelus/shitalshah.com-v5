Google search revenue has actually been increasing over past quarters. Itâ€™s the power of defaults.

For search engine change, first tech folks must do the manual switch and find 10X happiness.

It then takes ~2 yrs before they help rest of the population to change their defaults. <https://x.com/levelsio/status/1852329903317799019>

New search engine efforts have consistently failed in allowing to quickly set default or provide 10X happiness. 

For example, there is no iOS action for ChatGPT search or dedicated domains taking same query string.

New search engines seem to just ignore the power of default.
