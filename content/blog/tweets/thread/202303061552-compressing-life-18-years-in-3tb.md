ALL of the video and audio that a person will experience in 18 years of life span can be compressed into mere 3TB file with H265+ codec @ 640x480x10Hz.

Training a model with multimodal data to encompass human experiences is within our reach.

I find this fascinating because: (1) vast majority of our learnings occur through audio/visual senses, (2) our experiences that prepares us to be an independent adult humans fits on tiny &lt;$100 drive, (3) it sets an upper bound for # of params for the model.
