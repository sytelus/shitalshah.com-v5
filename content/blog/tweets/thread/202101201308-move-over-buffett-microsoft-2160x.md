How good strategies are over 40-50yrs?

Deeply researched value:
Waren Buffet: 72X 

Passive large cap index:
S&amp;P 500: 29X

Passive industry diversified:
DJI: 33X

Passive tech:
Nasdaq: 67X

Top tech:
AAPL: 846X
MSFT:2160X <https://t.co/ymBAyuMRdK>

Lesson:

Buffets favorite passive strategy (i.e. S&amp;P 500 and forget) is far from optimal. Top 3 to 5 tech which has survived 5+ years is much better “index”. Passively rebalance every year and you should outperform Buffet’s full time active strategy any day.
