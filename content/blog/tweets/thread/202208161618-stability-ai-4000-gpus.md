Stability AI suddenly came out of nowhere. There is almost no information on people behind it. It turns out it is funded by one rich guy driven to open source AI models. Apparently 4000 A100s is all you need! A lot more is in pipeline and I suspect things will never be the same. <https://x.com/ykilcher/status/1558413856988450817>

If you just came out of the cave, you ought to checkout the hashtag #StableDiffusion. Kudos to Mostaque and his team for unwavering commitment to open source, the courage and the vision.

There was a moment in time when I realized humans will never be able to beat computers in chess. The entire proud and prized territory of human dominance treasured through millennia had collapsed permanently. In retrospect it all looks trivial and inevitable. Today, it is art.
