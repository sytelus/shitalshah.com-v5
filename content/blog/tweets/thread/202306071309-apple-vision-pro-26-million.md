Some estimates on how much Apple revenues might go up because of Vision Pro in first year:

- There are 26M people who travel business class. A typical business class fare costs same as device.

- Top 26M wealthiest people in the world have net worth of $3.5M or more.

1/2

So, this may be Apple’s base market. Not all of these ppl will buy the device but a lot of less wealthy people will also buy device. One can estimate at least 10M device sells in 1st year. That’s 10% revenue growth conservatively.

That’s quite impressive!
