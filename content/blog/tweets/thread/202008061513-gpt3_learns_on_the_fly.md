These experiments by [@MelMitchell1](https://x.com/MelMitchell1) are quite surreal. Given that GPT-3 training data didnâ€™t had any of these examples (which is why 1-5 shot learning), this *online* generalization is truly bewildering!

So far I have been in camp that there is a clear line between pattern recognition and reasoning. Much of the ML and DL operates in pattern recognition land often masquerading as reasoning in narrow domain. But more I see GPT-3 results more it seems that the line is pretty blurry.
