Beauty is in the complexity. A delicate balance of conformance while defying it with the determination. A dance of embracing the structure while being hugged by all enveloping chaos. When simple things look beautiful, thatâ€™s because they are complex, giving it away only..

a tiny glimpse of their struggle in those ever fleeting moments. Telling it all while saying nothing but only if you can hear it. So dear world, let me present to you one of those beauties...

PS: no, I haven't found a sound system loud enough to fully appreciate it.
