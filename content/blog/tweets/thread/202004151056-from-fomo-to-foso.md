You have heard of FOMO. You even know about JOMO. Today we introduce a new term in this family: 

FOSO (noun); abbreviation for "fear of spreading out": a worried feeling that you may spread too thin if you venture outside the area of your expertise.

Example Usage:

"He is a great physicist but he just don't want me to talk about this idea of annealing the learning rate because he thinks he is not a computer science guy."

"Oh, does he has FOSO?"
