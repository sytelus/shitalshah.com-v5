I need to prepare a poster of size 841x1189 mm. I'm wondering how the last digits were decided. I can't find any other unit that can divide 841mm integrally. Its hex or octal equivalent doesn't end with 0. I wonder organizers really wanted to stress not a millimeter less or more.

Ah... this is actually A0 size which is defined as paper with 1 m^2 of area and dimension ratio of 1:sqrt(2). A1 is same ratio but the quarter area and so on. The sqrt(2) has the advantage that A1, A2 etc have same aspect ratio. Conference organizers are hereby declared innocent.
