We are getting first glimpse of what even minor improvements in frontier models would mean. <https://x.com/KevinAFischer/status/1764892031233765421>

More surprises piling up: <https://x.com/GillVerd/status/1764901418664882327>

Another example... I will keep this thread going.

Thread continues... So, this model natively talks in ASCII and reveals things that would make us go OMG!

To get perfect SAT scores, you have to be in top 0.07% of the test takers. Claude 3 is currently the only model to achieve this (for the reading part, which IMO is harder).

In context ‚Äúfine tuning‚Äù becoming pretty real with large context! <https://x.com/skirano/status/1765461051896721439>

Long context + better model pushes to truly ‚Äúco-worker‚Äù level productivity. Claude 3 here did same work E2E in zero shot as highly experienced engineer would do in an hour! <https://x.com/moyix/status/1765967602982027550>

This is kind of reasoning I haven‚Äôt seen in previous frontier models. <https://x.com/sytelus/status/1765557725365502177>

Claude can fix fairly complex bugs! <https://x.com/cognitivecompai/status/1766702300620554292>
