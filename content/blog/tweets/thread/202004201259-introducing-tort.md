I think I just invented a metric I would call tort (for task mortality). It's a measure of how wide spread and lasting effect a task performed by a human had. Next time when you are asking "is doing X worth my time?", you are really asking what is the tort of X.

If you are asking what is the precise definition of tort, I haven't really figured it out (need to work out few technical problems).
&lt;/flag_planted&gt;
