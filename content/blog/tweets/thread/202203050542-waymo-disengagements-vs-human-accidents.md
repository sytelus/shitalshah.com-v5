American drives 3T miles each year. There are 6M accidents each year. That comes out to be 1 accident per 0.5M miles. Waymo's disenagement rate was 1 per 12K miles. \ <https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack/status/1499803694522589187>

While disengagement and accidents are not the same, one can argue that for acceptable L5 self-driving, driver is not expected to be engaged and therefore we need these rates to be same. \

If disengagement rate continues improving 50%/yr, it would take at least 10 yrs before it becomes acceptable. With this rather naive guestimates, it appears L5 self-driving *may* happen around 2032. [@ID_AA_Carmack](https://x.com/ID_AA_Carmack)  might lose the bet against [@codinghorror](https://x.com/codinghorror)  by few yrs. \

Lesson learned: Use base-2 system, not decimal. Make bets for 16 years, not 10.
