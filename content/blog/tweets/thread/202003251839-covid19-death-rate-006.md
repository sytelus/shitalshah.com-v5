This WSJ article argues that the actual fatality rate for COVID-19 is possibly 0.06% as opposed to 1-6% touted in media.
The reasoning is based on estimating actual cases given confirmed cases. For example, in the Italian town VÃ², the entire population was tested to find...

a prevalence rate of 2.7%. Apply this to the whole province to estimate actual cases and then divide that by confirmed deaths. So assuming that unconfirmed cases mostly recovered without an event, the actual fatality rate goes down to 0.06%.

Arguably, the author doesn't have...

a lot of other strong data to back this up. Also, this would imply that a large part of the infected population simply recovered without needing to possibly sick treatment.

If this is true, however, it would mean we just had a 2 trillion dollar party
