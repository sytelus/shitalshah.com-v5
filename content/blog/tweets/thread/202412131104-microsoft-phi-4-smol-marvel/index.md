Are you ready for an early Christmas present from our team at Microsoft Research?

Introducing the most powerful smol model ever built in the world!

Welcome to Phi-4! üëá

Personally, since I started working on Phi project at its inception, this is my most favorite model that we have ever shipped.

Remember prompts that many frontier models including o1-preview struggled with? Phi-4 gave correct answer super fast!

Phi-4 achieves this by pushing the art of synthetic data even further to induce reasoning abilities along with new advancements in post-training.

If you have been using Llama 3.x etc for reasoning tasks, you owe it to yourself to try out Phi-4!

This is the work of super hard working team including [@EldanRonen](https://x.com/EldanRonen) [@BehlHarkirat](https://x.com/BehlHarkirat) [@mojan_jp](https://x.com/mojan_jp) [@marah](https://x.com/marah) [@marah_i_abdin](https://x.com/marah_i_abdin) [@weishliu](https://x.com/weishliu) [@rosaguga](https://x.com/rosaguga) [@OlliSaarikivi](https://x.com/OlliSaarikivi) [@suriyagnskr](https://x.com/suriyagnskr) [@SebastienBubeck](https://x.com/SebastienBubeck) and many others.

Of course, none of this would have been possible without  support from our amazing‚Ä¶

Model is available now to try in Azure: <https://ai.azure.com/explore/models/Phi-4/version/1/registry/azureml>

What's better than tokens? Tokens with logits!!

We hope you will have as much fun playing and creating with this tiny beast of a model as we had building it.

Happy holiday chilln' for ya allüéÑüéÅ.

Oh... and one more thing! if you love to push model capabilities and want to work with us, check out our summer internship position. I am at #NeurIPS and let me know if you had like to chat more about this position.
