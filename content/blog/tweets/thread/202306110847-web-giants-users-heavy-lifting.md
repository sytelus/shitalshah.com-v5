Websites like Reddit, Stackoverflow, Twitter etc gets entirety of their value from millions of users spending billions of hours in creating the content. Relatively the company itself spends a tiny fraction of that time creating those systems. 1/2

Still, all content is owned by those companies, not the people. Companies block progress by blocking access to content they didn’t even create. It’s like if you created the roads, you own everything that ever gets created using those roads. 

I call this “information capitalism”.
