Steve Jobs created many things and also destroyed many. One of them is the openness of platforms and another is what I'd call *delightful complexity*. Simplicity is not always a joy and a lot of overjealous wanna-be-Jobs seem to forget about that.

Achieving simplicity is much harder than achieving complexity but achieving *delightful complexity* is much much harder than achieving simplicity.

The world is interesting not because it’s on simple or complex extremes but it’s somewhere where I’d call it *delightfully complex*. We marvel at universe because there is far more to it than just be simple. True design gems are not just simple but *delightfully complex*.

I guess now I just sound like [@naval](https://x.com/naval) so I should probably stop.
