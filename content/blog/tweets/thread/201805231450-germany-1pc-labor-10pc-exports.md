Germany has 1% of the labor force of the world and has 10% share of world's exports.

This is mainly credited to apprentice program where students after 10th grade joins a company for specific technical skills. Company pays for their 3 years of training and further education. It is also not uncommon to re-invest 8-10% of revenue in to R&amp;D for German companies.
