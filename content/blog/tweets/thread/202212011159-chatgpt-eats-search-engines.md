I tried out new ChatGPT by OpenAI, threw at it all kind of queries. We are probably just 2-3 yrs away when these models can answer majority of search queries *much* better than classical search engines. This is one of the biggest leaps in info-retri/syn.

We donâ€™t realize but majority of our queries are conversational. Distributed serving, structured data ingestion and continuous training are big infrastructure pieces that needs to be done but it does seems to fit into index shards architecture and looks very doable.

There still will be usual index to compliment but at much smaller scale, sort of a fallback. We will have re-learn quite bit as well, mainly not try to guess the keywords.
