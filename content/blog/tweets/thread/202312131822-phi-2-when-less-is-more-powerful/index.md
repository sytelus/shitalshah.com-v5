Mistral-7B is cool but you know what's cooler? A more powerful model in just 1/3rd of the size!

Welcome to Phi-2.

This is something our team at Microsoft Research had been tirelessly working on and now we have more numbers comparing with Llama-7B, 13B, 70B and Gemini Nano. ðŸ‘‡

Phi-2 is best in the class model beating models 3X of it's size and in many cases even much much larger. Phi-2 especially shines in Math and Coding:

Want to give Phi-2 a try? Here is how:

1. Go to <http://portal.azure.com>, create an account if you don't have one

2. Go here: <http://aka.ms/phi2az>

Our Phi-2 efforts proves that we had been wasting enormous amount of compute on rather ineffective training data. Throwing a kitchen sink at model has a big price tag and lower quality.
