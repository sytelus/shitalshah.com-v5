Amazing list of disruptive technologies for 2019 straight from Bill Gates. Missing perhaps for the right reasons: Quantum computing, “AI”, RL, self-driving cars, reusable rockets. Google gets 4 mentions, Apple 1, Microsoft 0.

The list is amazing for its comprehensiveness going far beyond usual computers/software/internet world that we often mistake as all of the tech world. Every single one of this project is absolutely worth spending life on and for government+industry to heavily invest in.
