[@naval](https://x.com/naval) Ravikant is my favorite modern thinker and listening to his interview was like standing below the Niagara of insights and analysis on life, universe and everything.

There are few controversial points that I have had as well but Naval articulates much better and few that I donâ€™t quite agree. This is the kind of stuff that you pause, take time to digest and continue (took me 3 days to finish!). Available on various podcast apps for drive time.
