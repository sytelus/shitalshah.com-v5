Just came across Knuth's wonderful paper "Dancing Links". With his signature lucid style in the spirit of just having fun it takes reader on a roller coaster ride from linked list insertion to backtracking to massively improving algorithms for NP-complete problems.

At some point we will need to declare Knuth's papers sort of UNESCO World Heritage.
