We don’t know how future moral standards will look like. May be all non-vegetarian people will be looked down as insensitive, barbaric and inhuman for killing animals just for the taste. May be all men with mustaches will be loathed upon for subtle display of machoism. 1/2

We don’t know how to live by moral standards of 2089. So it should make sense that we shouldn’t force all dead people to live by moral standards of our times. 2/2
