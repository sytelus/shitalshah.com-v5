Ouch! This paper tried replicating 18 papers in the area of recommendations using deep learning but could replicate only 7. And 6 of those 7 could be outperformed with simple heuristic while 7th could be outperformed by well-tuned non-neural method.

Even though this is a very small dataset, correlation with h5-index is inescapable!

Conference | reproducibility | h5-index
KDD    | 43% | 77
