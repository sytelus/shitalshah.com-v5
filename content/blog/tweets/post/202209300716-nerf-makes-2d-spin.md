This is quite amazing and clever. A lot of people wanted this but they canâ€™t do it because there is no rich 3D dataset. Here authors generate 2D image but then they loop in NeRF model to optimize output at different angles and thus eliminating any need for 3D dataset!! <https://x.com/poolio/status/1575576632068214785>
