Same experience. Influencers are hyping up cherry picked cases.  As the size of generated code increases, so the chance of getting various errors. Sonnet 3.5 often fails to fix those errors and makes bigger mess. Current models are nowhere close for full project generations. <https://x.com/mayowaoshin/status/1833557628401627245>
