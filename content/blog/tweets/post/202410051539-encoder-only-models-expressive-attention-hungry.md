So encoder only next token predictors are perfectly feasible but they are just not practical because we will need to recompute per token attention each time.

However, encoder-only models are way more expressive because in input sequence (x1, . . . , xn), any token x_i canâ€¦ <https://x.com/Kangwook_Lee/status/1842020800620040549>
