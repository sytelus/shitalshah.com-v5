Bar at [@nature](https://x.com/nature) had been doing down the drain. Last few papers there had no source release/reproducibility checks. In a latest paper authors describe their system as “AI system” over and over but reviewers were ok. BTW, did you know [@nature](https://x.com/nature) is pay walled, no better than [@elsevier](https://x.com/elsevier).
