I'd been looking for Chrome plugin to easily bookmark, organize, summarize and annotate zillions of articles and papers I'm plowing through. Obviously this needs to be lightweight and frictionless. And then I found [@diigo](https://x.com/diigo). This is one of the tools that can change your life :).
