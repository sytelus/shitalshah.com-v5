After using [@paypal](https://x.com/paypal) for years, I'm learning it is a VERY bad payment option compared to credit card. It's "Payment Protection" is basically a sham which means if you get duped you can't just void the payment like in CC (1st hand experience). Of course there is no points/cashback.
