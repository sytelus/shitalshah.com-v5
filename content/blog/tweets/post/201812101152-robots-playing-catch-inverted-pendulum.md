This was very cool work by Dario Brescianini el al from Raffaello's lab at ETH in 2015. There is little learning involved but the main idea is to derive diff eq for kinmatics of pole thrown and caught as inverted pendulum (all pose estimation through mocap). <https://x.com/hardmaru/status/1071971010025537537>
