This would be another multi-billion dollar AI business. A ton of content like Game of Thrones, Rome, Matrix etc are off limits to minors because of few inappropriate scenes/language. If AI can edit/delete them and create PG version, it opens up Disney worth of streaming business. <https://x.com/mrgreen/status/1625521497065369606>
