I think this is quite interesting. Godel’s theorem says that finite set of *consistent* axioms leads to infinite set of statements that can’t be proven or disproven. “Graham’s Conjecture” below states that finite *inconsistent* axioms can prover or disprove any statement. <https://x.com/paulg/status/1358382033832181762>
