Midjourney v5 is quite something. Just 11 people team productized diffusion research from v1 to v5 in less than a year. It gets hands right finally but still canâ€™t write letters properly (solved in Imagen but no one has productized yet). Below results are still amazing. <https://x.com/venturetwins/status/1640038880325009408>
