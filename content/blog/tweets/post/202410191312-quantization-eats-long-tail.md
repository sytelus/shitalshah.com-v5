Great finding that I think is probably more generalizable: rarer domains gets way more impacted from quantization. This is loss of long tail for quantized models.

Many quantization methods involve fine-tuning but rarer domains wonâ€™t get fully restored. <https://x.com/cheeesio/status/1846913815624982802>
