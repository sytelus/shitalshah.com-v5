Cool theoretical finding: 

If you randomly sample weights until it perfectly fits your training data, those weights will also generalize well ðŸ™€

The way Iâ€™m thinking about this: When random sampling, probability of finding small set of good weights that fits data is far moreâ€¦ <https://x.com/gon_buzaglo/status/1756985928109682936>
