If you can express algorithm as recursive function that creates &gt; 1 call to itself at each level then you can massively parallelize it. Fortunately, a ton of algorithms in linear algebra, trees and graphs can be expressed this way. We already have GPUs with 1000s of computeâ€¦ <https://x.com/VictorTaelin/status/1781461120399618499>
