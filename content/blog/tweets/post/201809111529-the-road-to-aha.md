This is an excellent and very inspiring experiment journal kept by [@gpoleclerc](https://x.com/gpoleclerc). I wish more research papers had journals such as this. The insights in to intutions that didnâ€™t worked, time investments, path to aha moments would be invaluable to readers. <https://github.com/mitdbg/fastdeepnets/blob/master/journal.md>
