[@Comcast](https://x.com/Comcast) chatbot now uses caller ID and does modem reset. It inserts artificial delay with keyboard typing noise to make you feel thing is working hard :). These days I have to call them too often. I guess they have given up fixing the system. I need a bot to auto call their bot.
