Love this thread... how little things have built up our modern world. No one knows these innovators. Each of us are literally adding just another speck of dust in the bucket. When we add that our own little speck, it stays with humanity for a long time and changes a lot of lives. <https://x.com/juliagalef/status/1358865203463655427>
