This is excellent work! Depth from motion is something we had debated a lot last year. They are using different approach though... data comes from YouTube videos of static scene with moving cameras so geometric algos can generate semi-ground truth depth, limited to human poses. <https://x.com/GoogleAI/status/1131615568753115136>
