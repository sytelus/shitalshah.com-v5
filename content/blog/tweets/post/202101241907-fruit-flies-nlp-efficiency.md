“It is shown that not only can the fruit fly network motif achieve performance comparable to existing methods in NLP, but, addition- ally, it uses only a fraction of the computational resources (shorter training time and smaller memory footprint).” <https://x.com/arxiv_cscl/status/1353276457989111810>
