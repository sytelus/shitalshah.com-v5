Analysts 2023 predictions below. Not useful as they are all over. My feeling: 2022 dealt with fears of nuclear war, Taiwan tensions, China lockdowns, winter energy crisis. Things feels less worrisome today and more getting back towards normal while we deal with QE withdrawal. <https://x.com/GRDecter/status/1608937814003154945>
