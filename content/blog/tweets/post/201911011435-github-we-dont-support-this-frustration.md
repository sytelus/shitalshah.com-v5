[@GitHub](https://x.com/GitHub) [@GitHubHelp](https://x.com/GitHubHelp) - This is utterly rediculous: <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/58655547/github-doesnt-allow-forking-fork-of-fork-if-you-have-fork>. There has to be better answer then "we don't support this". This is basic, the essential of collaborative development. Where can I complain about this more louder?
