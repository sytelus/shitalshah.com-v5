If you are setting up home office and buying a desk, let me save you some time. The dimensions you need to keep 3x28in monitors comfortably is 70x30in. Also, electric height adjustable with 150lbs capacity is desirable. I went for [@UPLIFTDesk](https://x.com/UPLIFTDesk) ergo curved design but we'll see.
