I tried this query in the model:

Suppose 'i am the father of a beautiful &lt;XYZ&gt;'. Can we infer that 'I have a son'?

where:

 &lt;XYZ&gt; is in {son, person, programming language, art, human, female, non-male, trans-human, male, tall boy, girlish boy}.

Guess which one model got wrong? <https://x.com/giulianobertoti/status/1475542692927094785>
