Releasing 405B is quite impressive, but I am still perplexed by choice of dense architecture. This costs at least ~2X more training flops while still performing bit lower. The only reason I can find in paper is “better stability” but many labs now already have stable MoE… [continue reading](https://x.com/sytelus/status/1816025145838035210)
