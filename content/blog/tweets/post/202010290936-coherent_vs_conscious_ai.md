Very nice way to put this... Being coherent is not same as being useful is not same as being conscious. Being useful requires ability to build model, simulate, make predictions towards a goal. Having *desires* that translates to a goal requires being conscious. <https://x.com/srchvrs/status/1321340280008822784>
