IEEE is practically a scam. Vast majority of their publications are not open access. They are not available to even members even after paying absurd fees!! Anyone can start “IEEE” franchise conference without any bar. If you hate Elsevier then you should be hating IEEE even more. <https://x.com/docmilanfar/status/1359005117496791040>
