For Mumbai, number of days with 90F or more have been increased by whopping 50% since I was born! So now Mumbai has summer effectively 65% of the year. In next 40 years, there is good chance that Mumbai will have almost year around 90F days!! <https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/08/30/climate/how-much-hotter-is-your-hometown.html>
