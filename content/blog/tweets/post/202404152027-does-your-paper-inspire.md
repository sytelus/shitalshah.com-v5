A great test that I’d learned for whether a paper is worthwhile was from [@erichorvitz](https://x.com/erichorvitz) : Would it inspire the new work in the community?

To this day I find it deeply insightful that good papers are rarely about big breakthrough or SOTA and much more about inspiring the next work. <https://x.com/ylecun/status/1483583471343783948>
