A new era in robotics might just be around the corner. Fei-Fei Li’s group is working on “ImageNet for Robotics”! With LLM based prompt/perception/control just beginning to take shape, a large scale challenge might just finally do the trick for “Robotics winter”. Very exciting! <https://x.com/Jeande_d/status/1575569935467569152>
