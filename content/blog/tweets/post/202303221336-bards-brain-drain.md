1. Bard seems much weaker at reasoning+coding likely due to smaller model, less code in training data and no code-first training.

2. Needs more prompt engineering (weaker RLHF alternative).

3. Smaller context/history.

4. Uses search for freshness and tools like calculator. <https://x.com/deedydas/status/1638356068870033408>
