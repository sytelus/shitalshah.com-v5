New advances in AutoML from my [@MSFTResearch](https://x.com/MSFTResearch) colleagues! They have created a new algorithm called Petridish that finds network architecture more efficiently *and* requiring fewer parameters beating hand-tuned as well as many well-established methods. <https://x.com/debadeepta/status/1136004925559721984>
