I am not sure how authors resisted "ResNet is all you need" title :). Great paper overall showing that ResNet-50 matches or beats versions of EfficientNet and ViT when you improve training procedure (even when that training procedure is also used for EfficientNet and ViT)! <https://x.com/wightmanr/status/1444852719773122565>
