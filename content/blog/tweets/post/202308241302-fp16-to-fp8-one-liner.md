Below is super nice! Iâ€™ve spent fair chunk of my life  to get FP16 working flawlessly. Now with amp integrated in PyTorch, things are easier but you can still spot missing/incorrect calls in lot of OSS. Below one liner makes all that go away. If you have H100s, FP8 is pure gold. <https://x.com/thecharlieblake/status/1694281272527372349>
