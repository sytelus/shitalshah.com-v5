A wonderful, inspiring paper! Transformer models can just barely pass math exam for 16-years old. While current archs are relatively good at answering questions such as “Let k(c) = -611*c + 2188857. Is k(-103) != 2251790?”, problem remains challenging. The dataset is now public. <https://x.com/pushmeet/status/1113439439152402432>
