Visual Music lets you play 128 musical instruments on your PC including Flute, Bagpiper and even whistle! You can even record what you are playing, edit it and save it in a file. If you not expert at playing synthesiser keyboard, it provides you a easy to use scripting language to create music just by telling what key in which instrument you want to play for how much time!
