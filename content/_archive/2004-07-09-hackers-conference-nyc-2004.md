The [Fifth HOPE conference][1] featuring talks, workshops, movies and other events from several well known hackers including Steve Wozniak, Cult of Dead Cow, John Draper and so on is already started at NYC today (July 9, 2004). I'd read lot about many of these people dedicated to pure hacking in early years in the book [Hackers][2] and now its a chance to actually hear them! The conference has 70+ talks which itself is pretty long list even to browse through. Here are my picks from the list:

  * Bypassing Corporate Restrictions from the Inside -Saturday 2000
  * The Fifth HOPE Closing Ceremonies - Sunday 1900
  * Hack Nano - Friday 2000
