    <p>
      Over the time there were several programs penned out of my PC for use in development activities, to do some "hacking" or just have plain fun. Most of them were either known to my collegues or just by me until I realized that some of those tools were really "most wanted" by other software developers too. So it's now all here. Because of time constraint I wasn't able to document all of them or even make bit more user friendly but I guess person passing through same situation as mine would find it quite useful.
