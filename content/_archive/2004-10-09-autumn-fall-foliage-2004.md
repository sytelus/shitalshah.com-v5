If you are reading this and haven't been out there, well, you already missed the biggest blast of colors in Adirondacks (NY). On [US east coast][1], [Maine][2] and an odd little dot in the heart of [Adirondacks][3] are two places where the amazing fall colors appears first. Last year, just by pure fortune, [I was in Adirondacks][4] and in one of the first mornings I saw a sudden blast of color everywhere in the region. So we took the flight over 46 tall mountains (and the countless small ones) that makes up this amazingly beautiful area. The aerial views we saw from the small plane flying low were definitely the best fall foliage view I’ve ever seen (and for the record, I’d been [out][5] quite [a lot][6]).

Anyway, last weekend was the day when colors had peaked again at Adirondacks and after a week of blazing show that nature had put there, the area is now past peak (along with [Vermont][7] and much of the [New Hampshire][8] – which is often compared with China for the best in fall foliage in entire world because of the diversity of trees). But if you plan well, you can still chase the fall foliage on the East coast for this entire month and enjoy the blazing colors in truly awesome settings! After some researching in to my collection of links and reviewing fall foliage reports from various states, I've prepared [this Excel sheet][9] for the approximate times for fall foliage peak colors. So go out and have fun!
