If you have found Sony NEX-5 Camera in a black carry on, please do [let me know][1]! Itâ€™s pictures inside that are important, not the camera itself. So I would be very happy to buy you a beer or take you on a nice hike (whatever is your fix) if you have seen this thing at Lincoln Park beach in West Seattle near Alki beach area.
