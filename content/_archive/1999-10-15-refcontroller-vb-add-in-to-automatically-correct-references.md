It's not unusual to see "Missing References" when you open the VB project and then take the pain of correcting them by hand. If it has became your daily routine and you are really tired of that, here's the magic VB Add-In that will save you from that! This add-in monitors the state of references when you open the VB project. If it's Missing or not proper, it will look in to VBP file and try to locate the DLL and correct that bad reference for you! Besides everything else, it shows how to write self-installing VB Add-In and some cool add-in techniques. If you said WOW, head on for download!
