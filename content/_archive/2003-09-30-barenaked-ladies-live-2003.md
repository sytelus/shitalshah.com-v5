[Barenaked Ladies][1] will be performing live at New York on 22nd Oct. These guys concerts (there's no female members in the band - for the unawares) are among the most fun live events, so don't delay in [getting tickets][2]! Even more, these are the few of rare artists who prefer to perform live and then put the song in a album rather then other way around. I didn't thought they would be doing any tours. [Pinch me][3] if I'm still asleep ðŸ™‚
