Flying is nearly every human's dream and unstoppable desire. And now it's possible to get enroll in to private pilot licence program, stay in a budget ($120/lesson without discounts) and see how the world looks from the eyes of the clouds! If you are a [Star-Trek][1] fan, you already know what I'm talking about. So get your feet off the ground and prepare to give that baby a little spin! Check out for the small airports around your area where you can almost usually find a flight training schools which may allow you to take a test or just walk-in lesson. And don't worry. You will be putting your hands on very small planes like Cessna 152 which is fun to fly but you can't really hurt anybody, ofcourse except yourself :-).
