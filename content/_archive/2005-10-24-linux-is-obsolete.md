So far I've looked at Linux as something that people accept as religion rather than something with a substance and solid grounds. If you are a purist, you would get hurt to see the way Linux architecture is based on technically outdated 70s operating system and no amount of hype can convince you that this thing won't hit the wall sooner or later. To be precise, Linux essentially functions as stop gap quickly pulled out hack just to keep geeks going who are apparently as much in need of a religion just as most other human beings. This is the type of arguments I have had few years back with a Linux zeolet and it all got fresh when I was reading this 1992 email thread with subject ["Linux Is Obsolete"][1] by Prof. Andrew Tanenbaumn and then replied by Linus Torvalds and later by few others including Ken Thompson! It's fun to read young Linus's fiery email replies to the critic and Tanenbaumn's calm and witty follow ups ðŸ™‚

On other topic, why does discussions threads that got created between 1990-1993 usually have a high quality?
