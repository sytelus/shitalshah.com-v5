The Observing Blog at S&T have [posted][1] this wonderful [movie][2] about celestial dance of some of the brightest objects in sky in August and September 2008, just after sunset. Unfortunately, for us in mid-northern latitudes (and especially Seattle weather), things won't be as bright and high but having these objects "collide" with each other and that too with crescent moon around looks beautiful!
