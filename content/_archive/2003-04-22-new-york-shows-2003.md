There are two shows currently on in New York city and it's last week for both (i.e. until 27th April 2003). One of them is International Auto show at 38th street and 11th avenue at Jacob K. Javits Convention Center (see <http://www.autoshowny.com>). You can open the doors of most commercial cars on display and sit in (including Hummer H2) to see how it feels like it. While this might be exciting for some people, I found it more or less boring. It's like walking around a big parking lot. Except few Porches, Ferraris, Bentley and few concept cars everything else you can see on everyday roads in US anyway. The best car I saw was Bufori, a $110,000 machine which has 1930 classic looks from outside and ultra hi-tech from inside. The next event happening in NYC is [Macy's Flower Show][1] at Herald Square. I haven't been there but the flyer says over a million flowers, 30,000 species from 6 continents are on display. Spring rulez. Try not to miss it :). Next on the list is Central Park Summerstage. This is a popular summer destination where professional artists performs live and free of charge. This year [Jewel is going to be there on 10the May][2]. Jewel is one of my top favorites - probably the best female vocal on the planet. I've been looking for her concerts but there weren't any so far and now it's right here in central Park and that too free!! I got this alert from pollstar.com - these guys keeps keeps a watch on concerts and music events - but I can't get additional information or varification for this event.
