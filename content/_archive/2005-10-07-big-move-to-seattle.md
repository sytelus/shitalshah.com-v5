Okay... the (big) news time: We have moved out to all the way to&nbsp;the opposite&nbsp;coast and I've started my new work at Microsoft! More details will follow as I get some time from double pressure of moving and brand new job but suffice to say that Microsoft is possibly the ultimate geek destination on the planet and it shows up in&nbsp;all kind of&nbsp;little things.&nbsp;Microsoft technologies are driven to its maximum at the MS campuses and its perhaps the best showcase for the power of these technologies.&nbsp;In other news, the fall colors in Seattle area is much vivid and really bright from what [I used to see on east coast][1] and something we&nbsp;thought we would be missing at&nbsp;this Evergreen State ;). This place rocks!
