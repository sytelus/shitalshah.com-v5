Listening to [When I Fall][1] with sound of rain drops from my window... These days are going good. Haven't missed chance to get myself wet in rain most of the time... and walking on wet grass with bare feet... and watching rain drops making curves in cones of street lights... and taking a long drive in rain with my windows open... and taking snaps of Sun hiding behind dark clouds... and taking a deep breath in drizzly air... and wondering at water dance on my wind-shield... and following a droplet cloud around wheels of other vehicles... and making a splash on my way... These days are going good.
