[Evanescence][1] will be performing live at Webster Hall on 16th Sep in New York City as part of their tour. This is little unusual because even the [Webster Hall][2] is kind of the top dance club in the City, I never heard any concerts happening there. But probably thats what makes this cool. Check for [tickets and other tour locations][3]. But beaware, tickets are being distributed by [the worst ticketing site in the world][4].
