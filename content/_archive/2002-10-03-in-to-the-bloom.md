Spring is here and so the refreshing blooms! Take a closer look to nature's refreshing beauty by knowing the trees better. Can you identify at least 5 tress you will meet on the roads? Which tree doesn't loose their leaves in fall? Is male and female flowers separate for this one? That's just few questions you might. Get the pocket book [Trees : A Guide to Familiar American Trees][1] . If you are leaving neat New York city, visit [Central Park][2] - An ultra cool place for hang out. If you live somewhere else, search for the botanical gardens in your area or move on to road trips to state parks. Also check out the books on identifying flowers at [Amazon.com][3]
