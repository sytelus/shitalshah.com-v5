This is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. It does following of things: \ 1. Adds/removes line numbers from projects in a group. Unlike other add-ins, this one has been thoroughly tested on live complex projects for more then a year and has lots of code to workaround VB IDE object model bugs. It also does smart numbering (for example it won't number trivial assignment statements in Property Get). 2. This add-in can also add error handlers in all methods. Again unlike other similar utilities, this one has been thoroughly tested, accepts a directive to turn off error handler and has some decision making code to decide whether an error handler would effect actual logic. 3. Fix for VB's recent menu item bug (MRU) (you might have noticed VB's Recent project item menu always gets messed up). is an add-in for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. It does following of things: \ 1.
