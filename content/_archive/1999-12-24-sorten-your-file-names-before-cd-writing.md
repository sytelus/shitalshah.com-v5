If you are like me you would be maintaining backups of things ranging from your favorite links to ICQ logs on writable CDs. But there is a snag. There would be lots of files on your disk that has names more then 60 characters - like the .lnk file in your Favorite folder! And that crashes the CD writing process regularly because normal CD file system doesn't allow longer names. Solution? Sorten it! With this utility! This application is right now not in state of easy clicks. You might have to modify the source code for your needs.
