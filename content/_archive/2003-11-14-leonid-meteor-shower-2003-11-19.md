This event is slowing down every year and so for some people it would be a reason not to care and for others it would be a reason to care even more, because next year it will be more slower :). But it's still nice to see shooting stars with some predictability. This year, the peak time on East coast would be on 19th November between 12:00 to 2:30AM which is little earlier then past years. But again my wishes have already came true this year so don't have lots of wishes to make :). Nasa has <a href="http://leonid.arc.nasa.gov/estimator.html" target="new">really cool graphical estimator</a> for pick intensity for most cities in the world. For times on West coast and more details, <a href="http://www.physlink.com/News/111103LeonidMeteors.cfm" target="new">check out this press release</a>. Just don't expect something like that image of meteor shower on this site!
