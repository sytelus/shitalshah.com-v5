[Now Listening: [Tom Petty - You don't know how it feels][1]] Can't beat this clock... can't stop staring this screen... can't sleep these nights... can't leave this place... can't think... can't do better things... can't stop thinking... can't stop blood in these veins... can't see world less beautiful... can't find that piece of heart... can't contain in to self... can't hold her hand... can't breath out... can't fall in to comma... can't get closer to my sky... can't steal colors... can't get bigger space... can't stop meaningless talk... can't get bored with blahs... can't keep aweful silense... can't stop reaching out... can't stay alone... can't stop cursing... can't survive people... can't be bad... can't become one...
