For most people, it's not too hard to get bored of going popular, famous, major-attraction kind of places. In that case, may be we share the same blood of explorers. Since last many months I'm scouting for the places which are unknown, least populated, beautiful and lonely. In heavily populated states like New Jersey it's tough. Start by [TopoZone][1] - a site which tells you where's all those mountains, lakes, cliffs, falls, forests, valleys and even lava flows are! Buy a GPS ([Garmin's e-map][2] is a good one) and software Topo maps to take you there. If you are living in New Jersey, check out these [10 Most Beautiful Places][3] to visit. I'm planning to put up a writeup on good places to hike in NJ/NY/CN/PN before summer ends and as I get time but if you need that info right away [contact me][4].
