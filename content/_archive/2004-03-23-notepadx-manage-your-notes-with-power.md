NotepadX is a powerful program to let you to keep your notes in hierarchically organized categories. Also it not just allows you to create rich text/ plain text notes but also the notes which are like Worksheet or a treeview! It also supports encrypted secured notes so you can save your passwords and sensitive information safely. You can also create read-only notes and pass it around. The Edit-In-Word allows you to use Word for rich text formatting in case my basic editor didn't fit your needs. All your notes get saved in to one single XML file and for programmers, you have entire source code, several reusable components and nice object model if you need to tweak it. This has been my pass time project and several features are missing right now which I might work on in future, such as: integration with OneNote, search feature, export feature, merging of several notes etc.
