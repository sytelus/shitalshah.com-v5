My favorite online music service Rhapsody is not working for me these days. They _removed_ entire Linkin Park collection, few albums from Kid Rock and God knows what more. So I'm back to my old favorite Yahoo! Launch. They have gotten better with more selection, many more videos and more features. The best thing is, ofcourse, you can tell it what you liked and it will select more your kinda music rather then purely random songs. And it's totally free! You can [listen to my own customized radio station][1] which I'm listening to right now.
