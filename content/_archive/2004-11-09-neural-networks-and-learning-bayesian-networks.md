These are the two most interesting subjects for me right now. [This book on Neural Networks][1] is probably the best to take a dive in the field. This is truly the magnificent book that you can read like some thriller story (assuming you are not afraid of some mathematical depth) and look at the real working through cool numerical examples. Short but concise explanations might make this book deceptively tiny but it's sure the best introduction in this field.

On the other hand [Learning Bayesian Networks][2] is little dry but has solid examples and it promises answers to some of the puzzling questions that had been playing around in my mind while thinking about my own correlation algorithm. So itâ€™s still an interesting read. This book you can probably read more comfortably if you are already familiar with [Bayesian probabilities][3].
