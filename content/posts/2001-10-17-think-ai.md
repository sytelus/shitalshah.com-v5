I hate to say this, but this one is for computer programmers and that too who comes in geeky hardcore diehard flavors with a love for mathematics. If you are running out of quality challenges and you have started thinking that programming is as trivial as bank clerk's job, here's something you can face. As a programmer, Artificial Intelligence is the biggest, best and most worthwhile challenge ever to take upon! But what AI really means? where do I start? Check out the [Learning Machine Challenge][1] - an open challenge to whole world with crystal clear definition of what needs to be achieved from programmer's point of view. You can also find [my submission][2] to [a-i.com][3]'s Learning Machine Challenge. It's probably first ever "AI" program written in C# with capability to learn rules of any game while you play with it.
