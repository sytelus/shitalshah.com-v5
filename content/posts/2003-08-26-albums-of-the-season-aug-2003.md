Here's some from shopping list of past few months:

[Artist - Album]

  * Linkin Park - Meteora
  * Evanescence - Fallen
  * Audioslave - Audioslave
  * Macy Gray - On How Life Is
  * Barenaked Ladies - Rock Spectacle
  * 4 Strings - Take me away (into the night)

Evanescence's Fallen is probably the best thing came out this year. Audioslave is raw, hard and grungy. How Macy Gray came in to my list? I don't know... I'd written bad things about Meteora previously but when you are in real need for extreme screaming, lots of hatred and hard hard hard stuff these guys seems to fit the bill.
