Here are our [March 2004 Alaska trip photos][1].

I guess&nbsp;early March&nbsp;is among the best time to visit Alaska (thanks to my wife for figuring out fantastic itinerary)&nbsp;because you are still just in time to catch views of&nbsp;Aurora Boriales and there is so much festivities going on.&nbsp;We had our Yup'ik wedding ceremony at the [Ice Hotel at Chena Hotsprings][2]&nbsp;which is a hotel made of only ice with colorful lights shining through. Taking a dip in natural hot&nbsp;sulfur rich springs in below freezing temperatures with Aurora Borealis&nbsp;passing over head&nbsp;could certainly bring you one of the most memorable times even if its not your wedding ceremony&nbsp;night ;).&nbsp;We&nbsp;also attended the start of the world famous [Iditarod Sleddog Race][3] in&nbsp; Anchorage,&nbsp;went to&nbsp;the [Fur Rendezvous][4] (a big festival in Anchorage were furs and various Alaskan crafts are bought, sold, and traded),&nbsp; saw the [World Ice Carving Championship][5] in Fairbanks&nbsp;- a definite must see to believe these finely detailed&nbsp;sculpteurs carved out of ice, attended [Chatanika Days][6] (a festival in Chatanika where a outhouse, snowmobile, and other races are held), and visited [Whittier][7], the strangest town in Alaska.&nbsp; We&nbsp;also paid a visit to capitol "city"&nbsp;[Juneau][8] which is incredibly beautiful from "Lower 48" standards but not as desirable places to live from Alaskan standards :).&nbsp; We also camped in 4 feet of snow overnight near&nbsp;[Denali National Park][9], home of Denali/Mt. McKinley Mountain, the tallest mountain in North America. All that besides having lots of fun :).
