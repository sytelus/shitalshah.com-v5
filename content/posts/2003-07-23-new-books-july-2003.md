I'm running out of books to read so I was on shopping spree at Amazon. Just picked up few books from my [Wish List][1] and then few books from my favorite authors. 

  * [The Adventures of Tom Sawyer][2] 
  * [Gamma: Exploring Euler's Constant][3] 
  * [How Would You Move Mount Fuji? Microsoft's Cult of the Puzzle - How the World's Smartest Company Selects the Most Creative Thinkers][4] 
  * [Artificial Life: A Report from the Frontier Where Computers Meet Biology][5] 
  * [Just for Fun: The Story of an Accidental Revolutionary][6] 
  * [The Best American Science Writing 2002][7]
