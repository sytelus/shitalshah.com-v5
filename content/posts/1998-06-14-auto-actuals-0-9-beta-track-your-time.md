Have you ever felt that your time goes faster then the speed of light? Or have you ever had hard time to recollect what exactly you did whole month while filling your employer's timesheets? Or have you ever had desired to analyse how much portion of time you spend in meetings and reading emails? Or have you ever wanted to keep Star Trek style daily logs but never maintained it? Well, then this application is just for you! Once installed, AutoActuals will pop up on your screen at regular intervals and ask you what you were doing! And it's far more then that. It allows you to categorize your tasks, gives you hint on what program were you running all the time, generates reports in Word, maintains data in Access, supports multiuser access, supports task assignment and tracking by project managers and lot lot more. And all that in very simple intuitive UI! This application is right now in state of easy installation and no on-line help is available.
