Okay... found that! That song in the movie [American Beauty][1] with rain falling in one of the last scenes is <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/song/default.asp?songID=609626" target="new">Don't Let It Bring You Down By Neil Young</a>. Though <a href="http://launch.yahoo.com/song/default.asp?songID=716366" target="new">one by Annie Lennox</a> is much better. It was buzzing in my head since quite some time now.
