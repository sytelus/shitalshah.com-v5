This is collection of several reusable components to use in your WinForms application. I'd been building it up and reusing in my own personal applications such as BrowserHistoryAnalyser and NotepadX and others. It contains editable drag-n-drop enabled TreeView, RichText editor control with toolbar, Worksheet editor control, Password Input Form, MRU, custom attributes you can use for your assemblies, more easily usable hidden property editor control, advanced About Dialog, Application Options management and Assembly Info Viewer Control.
