The idea of wrapping calendar information in to the RSS feed may sound very appealing. Almost every website owned by some kind of group or organization has their event calendar. The thought that you can aggregate them in to your "Calendar Aggregator" is just so geekily cool. What if people started putting up their weekend plans through some kind of RSS-Calendar and you can subscribe to them in your calendar program! I dig through dozens of W3C and other specs and half a dozen of implementation to find out what has been done so far and why it hasn't happened yet. The result of my findings and possible solution are summarized in [my essay][1] in some reader friendly writing.
