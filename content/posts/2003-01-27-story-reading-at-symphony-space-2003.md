This one is cool artsy low-profile New York event. Nothing much happens: a celebrity comes on stage and reads you a short story. It's an experience, given the right story teller, how much different a story becomes when someone reads it to you. Visit [Symphony Space's website][1] to get more info on shows. I think shows will run through June. My last year's favorite was one called Boys from the Best American Short Stories. This will probably be repeated this year too. But watch out for it, that had been a sold out show last year!
