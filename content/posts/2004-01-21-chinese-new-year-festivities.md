While my wife would be celebrating <a href="http://chineseculture.about.com/library/weekly/topicsub1.htm?once=true&" target="new">Chinese New Year</a> on more native land of Hong Kong, there would be quite a few events happening in NEw York city. The <a href="http://gonyc.about.com/cs/holidays/a/chinesenewyear.htm" target="new">big parade</a> is on Sunday 25th in Chinatown with dragons and lions, all red and gold, along with <a href="http://www.taipei.org/even/newyearevent/chinesenewyear.html" target="new">other events</a>. Chinatown-Online gives nice little <a href="http://www.chinatown-online.com/year/year.shtml" target="new">info on traditions of Chinese New Year</a> and other festivities dates.

The major deal of New Year is, of course, lavish food festivities. There is a <a href="http://ccbany.org/restaurant_list.html" target="new">suprisingly large number of restaurants</a> in NYC which will be offering special New Year meals, but here are some select few places to get the Year of the Monkey off to a good start (Chanoodle is the most recommended): 

  * Chanoodle - (212) 349-1495 - 79 Mulberry Street (Canal Street), Chinatown
  * Congee - (212) 965-5028 - 98 Bowery (Near Hester Street)
  * Dim Sum Go Go - (212) 732-0797 - 5 East Broadway (Chatham Square)
  * Funky Broome - (212) 941-8628 - 176 Mott Street (Broome Street)
  * Joe's Ginger - 212) 966-6613 - 113 Mott Street (Near Hester Street)
  * Ping's Seafood - (212) 602-9988 - 22 Mott Street (Near Mosco Street)
  * Sunrise 27 - 212) 219-8498 - 27 Division Street (Near Market Street)
