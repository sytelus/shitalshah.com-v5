[@ani_pai](https://x.com/ani_pai) Imagine whole world decides to use Bitcoin. Next thing you will see is govts spinning up their massive data centers to produce their own supply. Individuals simply won't match tech and eventually, it would be same as govt owning money press. Implementation of PoW is irrelevant.
