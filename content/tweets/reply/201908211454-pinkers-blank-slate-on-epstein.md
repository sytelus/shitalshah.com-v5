[@KiwiDalang](https://x.com/KiwiDalang) [@xeni](https://x.com/xeni) [@sapinker](https://x.com/sapinker) has cleverly avoided answers to these:
1. Did he asked [@AlanDersh](https://x.com/AlanDersh) if Epstein was guilty before writing this note?
2. Did he not knew his letter *will* be used as expert opinion?
3. Did he believed Epstein should be saved from justice in 2008?

If not guilty, come clean.
