[@asmosel](https://x.com/asmosel) [@qikipedia](https://x.com/qikipedia) I am a short term kind of guy so I would rather worry about super volcano Yello Stone set to go off within next 50-100K years. Also people are worrying about Earthâ€™s magnetic field collapsing in few thousand years (Mars is supposed to have lost water because of that).
