[@jbowayles](https://x.com/jbowayles) [@ebetica](https://x.com/ebetica) This is good observation. In data science tasks we write small code chunks more often and so scaffolding and investment demanded by safety-first languages becomes expensive. In other class of applications we have large amount of monolithic code base and that investment pays of.
