[@lexfridman](https://x.com/lexfridman) But isnâ€™t this different from Cyc? Here we are not seeking to generate data for facts but rather describe behaviors that we consider aligned with humans. Ideally, the data required for alignment should be relatively small so it would be surprising if this turns into Cyc.
