[@patrickc](https://x.com/patrickc) Authors are granting very generous claims to themselves :). The survey (we need to stop calling surveys as “research”) *only* suggests that earlier discoveries are perceived as more important. This is not out of line as later discoveries are typically built on earlier ones.
