[@wgrosso](https://x.com/wgrosso) [@togelius](https://x.com/togelius) [@paulg](https://x.com/paulg) I would argue IQ tests cannot reliably sort individuals even in top 80%. We have no knowledge that people who sets these tests are the smartest on the planet. Very likely they are just some low paid psychologist available for fee whose other accomplishments in life are not known.
