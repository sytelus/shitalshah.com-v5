[@ducha_aiki](https://x.com/ducha_aiki) [@ozansener](https://x.com/ozansener) Minskyâ€™s proof story is popular but not true. I am very pragmatic engineer but I respect theory work big time. Without any theory your choice is to keep throwing arrows in the dark and hope you get lucky. Any theory, even the most approximate one, is better than no theory at all.
