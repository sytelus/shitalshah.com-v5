[@tkasasagi](https://x.com/tkasasagi) You probably want something like Dyson AM10. The problem with most cheap but cutely packaged humidifiers is that they donâ€™t have closed loop control to keep humidity strictly between 40 &amp; 50%. If humidity goes above 50% you may get mold that can cause other health issues.
