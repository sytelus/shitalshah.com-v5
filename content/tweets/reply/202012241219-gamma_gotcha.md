[@theshawwn](https://x.com/theshawwn) [@lacker](https://x.com/lacker) It cannot be, right? Letâ€™s say you are solving X*gamma=Y. For gamma initialized to 1, we are still solving the same equation but with gamma+1, we would actually be solving X*gamma + X = Y which is completely different equation.
