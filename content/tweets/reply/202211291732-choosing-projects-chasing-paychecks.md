[@philipcball](https://x.com/philipcball) [@ylecun](https://x.com/ylecun) Just wondering how were followings done:

- How did people chose projects? Did they created their own, their supervisor did assignment, did they found match somehow?

- Was there a performance review system? How did people got compensated for doing good work vs not doing much?
