[@togelius](https://x.com/togelius) [@paulg](https://x.com/paulg) You are assuming that “canonical” answers were obtained by systematically applying some Occam-optimal procedure. Very likely, they are simply the answers chosen by some guy who was tasked to setup this test. We apparently don’t question the IQ of people creating IQ tests.
