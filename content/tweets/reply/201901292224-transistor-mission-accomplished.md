[@gwern](https://x.com/gwern) 5/ For nearly 3 years junction transistor remained a theoretical concept. People started ways to realize the theory by figuring out processes for crystals etc. Theory guided all of these efforts. First junction transistor was made with exact specs predicted by the theory in 1951.
