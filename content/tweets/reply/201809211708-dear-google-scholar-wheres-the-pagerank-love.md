[@AidanRocke](https://x.com/AidanRocke) This is a problem of defining good robust metric and have community adopt it. Paper count, citation count and h-index are immensely flawed. PageRank is bit more robust and originality designed for this purpose but I just don’t know why Google Scholar itself didn’t implemented it.
