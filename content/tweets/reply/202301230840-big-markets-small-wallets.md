[@debarghya_das](https://x.com/debarghya_das) [@saransh92garg](https://x.com/saransh92garg) I would argue that larger size of market compensates for the purchasing power. That is, we should look at average disposable income * population. This should also be further calibrated by number of established big tech players and startup competition size.
