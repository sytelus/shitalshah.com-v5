[@srchvrs](https://x.com/srchvrs) I often suspect something may be wrong when people don’t want to promote their work. Usually instead of modesty, it’s often the fact that there are gaps such as non-reproducibility getting uncovered by public. If you are promoting the thing I atleast know darn thing has to work.
