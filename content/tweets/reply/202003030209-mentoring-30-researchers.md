[@thegautamkamath](https://x.com/thegautamkamath) I can see 30 doable as engineering manager but if the task is to groom people to be successful in long term research careers which may involve deep interactions on  selecting right problems, ethics, teaching etc, is this still doable? How much time per student/week is sufficient?
