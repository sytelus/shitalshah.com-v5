[@ayyar](https://x.com/ayyar) [@ykilcher](https://x.com/ykilcher) There is one legit criticism I saw: One can produce very scientific looking papers on racism, LGBT and other 4chan topics that are highly convincing as if written by experts providing evidence. So, you can take GPT-4chan entirely new levels that would mislead even careful public.
