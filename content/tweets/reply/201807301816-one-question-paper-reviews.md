[@zacharylipton](https://x.com/zacharylipton) What if reviewers rated each paper between 0 to 1 on a single question: “How important is this paper to you?”.  Then just fill available conference slots by simple sort. If paper doesn’t get in, it would be just because of lack of interest as opposed to lack of mathieness/theory.
