[@PreetumNakkiran](https://x.com/PreetumNakkiran) [@BlinkDL_AI](https://x.com/BlinkDL_AI) The systematic approach in this case would be “there are N problems with traditional RNN setup  which is why baseline don’t match transformer setup. Therefore we propose these K solutions based on our these P intuitions/beliefs/proofs. Now we match usual transformer baselines.”.
