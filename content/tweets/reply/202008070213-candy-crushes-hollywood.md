[@phil_bennett](https://x.com/phil_bennett) [@ctrlshifti](https://x.com/ctrlshifti) I think engineers undervalues them a lot. Software provides tremendous value to human society. Even outside of science, finances, silly games like candy crush provides entertainment value matching huge Hollywood blockbuster. Creating software is very very hard and value is huge.
