[@Raamana_](https://x.com/Raamana_) [@DAlperovitch](https://x.com/DAlperovitch) As I understand, SWIFT sanctions are very narrow and pointless at present. Markets are closed to stop temporary downturn. As in Crimea, all these will last few days until social media finds something else to focus on. West has no tolerance for financial losses due to sanctions.
