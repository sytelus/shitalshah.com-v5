[@dmonett](https://x.com/dmonett) Current “AI” will yield many super human narrow capabilities in 10yr but only as supplement for humans rather than full independent cognitively versatile entities like humans. GPUs with backprop will do many glorious things but AGI seems out of reach with this line of tech.
