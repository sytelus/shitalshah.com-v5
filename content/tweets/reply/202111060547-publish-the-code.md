[@srchvrs](https://x.com/srchvrs) [@bnjasim](https://x.com/bnjasim) [@thegautamkamath](https://x.com/thegautamkamath) Combined pain of 100s of people wasting their time trying to replicate your results is far more. If you are willing to spend time to produce manicured word-smithed pdf to get recognized in community, you better take pain to publish the code. Otherwise do blog post and be happy.
