Everyone has copied PyTorch, finally :). But I have to say clones are subtly imperfect but in an important way. They still don't get the design decisions made in PyTorch. Using tanh as actual function as opposed to string value specified as activation is precious. <https://x.com/fchollet/status/1052228463300493312>
