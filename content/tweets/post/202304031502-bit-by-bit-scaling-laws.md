This is a great paper! It makes sense to have scaling laws in terms of model bits as opposed to model parameters. 

This also immediately forces us to view quantization as rather a band-aid for our inability to find direct training procedure for an arbitrary sized parameters.â€¦ <https://x.com/finbarrtimbers/status/1642563284409917440>
