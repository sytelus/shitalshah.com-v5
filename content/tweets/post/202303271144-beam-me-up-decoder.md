The exponential divergence for autoregressive models should be solvable via better decoding algorithms. The decoder is in fact a “planner”. Beam search is in fact a local planner.  All practical control systems have an inner loop that produces finite k steps, just like AR models. <https://x.com/ylecun/status/1640122342570336267>
