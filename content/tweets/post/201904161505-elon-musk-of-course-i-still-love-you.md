So I'm a sucker for space launches, listen to SpaceX events in background and this time commentator kept saying "of course I still love you" out of the blue. It turned out that's the name [@elonmusk](https://x.com/elonmusk) gave to landing ship. Surprise he is voted most admired guy on the planet at SO?
