This is like ChatGPT but with citations!!

Quality seems bit below ChatGPT. Likely smaller model/less training on code/less RLHF data? 

Amazing to see a startup pulling this off in just ~2 months. 2023 is the year when 10 blue links are replaced with answer and dialog. <https://x.com/perplexity_ai/status/1616120452338036736>
