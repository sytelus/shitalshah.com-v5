When does ASICs make sense? The cost difference between 28nm vs 180nm process is &gt;10X. Similarly cost difference between 28nm vs 5nm process is &gt;10X. If you are shipping million units, combining chips into ASIC can come out ahead in cost! <https://www.electronicdesign.com/technologies/embedded-revolution/article/21808278/the-economics-of-asics-at-what-point-does-a-custom-soc-become-viable>
