wow... just wow. If you are researcher who happens to be black, ~48% chance is that you will not be allowed to attend NeurIPS! This is *after* the top leader of the country says he will fix the issue. What was the % *before*? I suspect we are not ready to enter the year 2020 yet. <https://x.com/math_rachel/status/1192690199215558656>
