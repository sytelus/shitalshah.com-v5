Training CIFAR-10 to 94% in shortest time is my beloved "ML sport". For those who are keeping track, last year [@hi_tysam](https://x.com/hi_tysam) crushed it with &lt;7 sec on single A100. The new record of 3.29s is totally insane.

Here's my very playable fork of tysam's code: <https://github.com/sytelus/hlb-CIFAR10> <https://x.com/kellerjordan0/status/1775980602732548177>
