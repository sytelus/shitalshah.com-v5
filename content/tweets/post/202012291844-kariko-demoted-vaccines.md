This is truly an amazing story. Kariko was demoted for her research agenda for mRNA, got cancer at the same time while her husband stranded outside the country! UPenn laughed her off from faculty position. Without her conviction COVID vaccine would not have been possible. <https://x.com/triketora/status/1343563466221748224>
