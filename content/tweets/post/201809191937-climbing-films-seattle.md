Two new (and long awaited) rock climbing movies are coming to town only for 1 show! The Dawn Wall is going to be shown today at Seattle, Bellevue and Redmond on 7 PM. The Free Solo is going to be only in Seattle on 12th Oct. <https://www.fathomevents.com/events/the-dawn-wall?date=2018-09-19%2000:00:00.000&utm_source=facebook&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=dawn+wall&utm_term=fathom&utm_content=dawn-wall-rt>
