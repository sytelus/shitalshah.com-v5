According to this paper ICL is the only emergent ability and “reasoning” has not yet emerged. To “prove” this, they seem to use 14 BigBench tasks and test without ICL. Paper looks expensive but claims still feels bold for the terms we don’t quite understand such as “reasoning”. <https://x.com/UKPLab/status/1699348822609060158>
