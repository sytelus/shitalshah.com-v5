Reminds me of my teen years when only 1 hour/week of computer time was all I could get. I would spend whole week writing code in my notebook, perfecting it so every last second of that 1 hour was spent efficiently. It melts my heart this is still same in many parts of the world. <https://x.com/GyenAbubakar/status/1350096836619595778>
