A cool thing about BLEU is stability. Avg human translator gets BLEU of ~40 and expert ~60. MT community chased cracking 40 cleanly for a long time. Only few people realize that HUGE achievement in Transformer paper was cracking that limit using a single model for the first time. <https://x.com/rasbt/status/1639271663735828483>
