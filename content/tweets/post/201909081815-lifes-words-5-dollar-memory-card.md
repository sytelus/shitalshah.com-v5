Average reading speed is 5 words/sec, average speaking speed is 2.7 words/sec. Human language processing maxes out at ~72 bits/sec. So max life time consumption of language material by a human is possibly just 18GB. Everything you ever read and heard can fit on $5 memory card! <https://x.com/timFinin/status/1170447289388818432>
