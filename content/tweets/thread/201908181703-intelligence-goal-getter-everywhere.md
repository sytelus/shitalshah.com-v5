This paper reviews largest collection of attempts to define intelligence and concludes with the following:
“Intelligence measures an agent's ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.”
<https://arxiv.org/abs/0706.3639> 1/n

I disagree. Environment doesn’t necessarily need to exist. An intelligent brain in a jar can play imaginary games with itself quite all right. And what does “wide” even mean? It should be surprising that all efforts at defining intelligence over centuries seems to have failed.2/n

I think it’s super important to formally define this quality we call “intelligence” so we know what we are talking about. It would help better formulate challenge problems we should strive to solve and measure our progress.
