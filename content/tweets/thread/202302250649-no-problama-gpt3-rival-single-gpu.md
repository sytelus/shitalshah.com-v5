You can now grab GPT-3 competitive model that runs on single GPU from LLaMA collection! Unlike previous OPT/BLOOM/GPT-NeoX attempts, LLaMA models are competitive with PaLM/GPT at compute optimal sizes while incorporating latest arch enhancements.   1/2 <https://x.com/ylecun/status/1629189925089296386>

The interesting thing about this effort is that they managed to train models only using open datasets. This at least means that foundation models wonâ€™t likely require proprietary data. This should be a big relief to many people worried about data leaks and infringement issues.
