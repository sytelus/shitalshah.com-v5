There is I-90 closure since past 24hr so good time to test map apps. Google Maps still has no idea and says I can get to pass in 45 mins. Bing Maps thinks I will get there in about 4 hr but doesnâ€™t know why. Only Apple Maps shows I cannot get there at all because of road closures

I am frankly surprised by ongoing Apple Maps superiority because in past I have trusted Google Maps blindly. This resulted in getting stuck in ferry lines for 6 hours while alternative route existed but Google Maps had no idea about massive delays.
