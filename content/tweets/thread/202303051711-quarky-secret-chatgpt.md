There is a mysterious secret sauce in original ChatGPT hosted at OpenAI. Many of my hard queries get only answered there.

Ex:

“What was that phrase in the book God Particle about quarks repelling each other if they came too close but attracting each other if they went too far?”

Every other bot fails, even ones using ChatGPT APIs. Only the original ChatGPT at OpenAI answers correctly (i.e. asymptomatic freedom).

Failed bots:

- Poe/ChatGPT
- Poe/Claude
- Poe/Sage
- Bing Chat
- Perplexity AI
- <http://You.com>
- davinci-001,002,003
- Flan-UL2
