Some raw thoughts... There were few movies in works this year, few music albums, few fashion designs, few new products and so on. This might create "draught" for many consumable categories in 2021. 1/n

As things go back to normal, demand will go in overdrive while supply still highly constrained. Stimulus will make this imbalance worse. One might expect 2021 to be highly inflationary year. All these can lead to stock prices exploding. Imagine Tesla P/E hitting 3000!
