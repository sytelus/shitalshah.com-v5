Hello there! I'm a Research Engineer at Microsoft Research with interests in deep learning and reinforcement learning.

Some of my open source works:

* I lead a team for the code infrastructure to train the Phi series of models: [Phi-1](https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/phi-1-6626e29134744e94e222d572), [Phi-2](https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/phi-2-6626e02ed138af2d2ec801cc), [Phi-3](https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/phi-3-6626e15e9585a200d2d761e3), [Phi-4](https://huggingface.co/collections/microsoft/phi-4-677e9380e514feb5577a40e4).
* I co-created [Archai](https://github.com/microsoft/archai), Neural Architecture Search (NAS) framework that we used to create one of the super tiny Transformer models powering the text completition feature in many Microsoft products.
* I conceived and created [AirSim](https://github.com/microsoft/airsim), a physically and visually realistic cross-platform simulator for AI research
* I conceived and created [TensorWatch](http://tensorwatch.org), a new approach for debugging training and visualization of vision models.

You can find a lot of my hobby projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/sytelus).

You can find research papers I contributed to at [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=1PEHzesAAAAJ).

You can follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/sytelus) for posts mainly on deep learning code and research.

##### About Site

This site is made with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator with slighly customized [Congo theme](https://github.com/jpanther/congo). The [source code](https://github.com/sytelus/shitalshah.com-v5) for this website is available freely. This website can also be visited at <https://shitalshah.com> and <https://sytelus.github.io/>. Pages on this website are not immutable and will be edited as neccesory.

A lot of content on this website is sourced from [my twitter account](https://x.com/sytelus). One of the goals was to move my content on Twitter/X out of its private data wall so it can be indexed and searched freely on Internet. To achieve this, I [exported](https://x.com/settings/download_your_data) my data out of Twitter and wrote [some code](https://github.com/sytelus/Tweeter2Blog) to convert it to markdown posts for this website.

Happy browsing!
