I thought I know everything there is to know about Google searching, until... I found there is an operator to search for synonyms and two words separated by a word and so on. Check out the [Google Cheetsheet][1]!

It appears that I'm often switching to [Clusty][2] for "hard to find" things - usually when Googles first page of results is just irrelevant. I think clustering is inevitable technology for search engines and really hope Google speeds up their effort for implementation. It isn't that hard, after all.
