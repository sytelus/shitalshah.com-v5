Did you knew that [Visual Basic.Net Resource Kit][1] has an utility to convert C# code to VB.Net? Of course there are [several online language converters][2] but this one works great. And that's besides having cool Dundas Chart control and tons of other components from Component One absolutely free (though their charting component is pretty miserable and requires free registration for licensing). Charting is seriously missing component in 2.0's toolbox.and I'm just [wondering][3] why doesn't MS thinks of bundling these components with VS.Net 2005 installer rather than keeping it in an lesser known corner of web.
