It should be a crime to buy a simple laptop instead of a tablet PC. But not just any tablet PC, mind you! Most tablet models are pretty miserable on specs tagged with high prices and geared more towards business people. But there is a gem out there for power users: check out [Acer TravelMate C303][1] - it just looks like a usual laptop until you fold the LCD and make it a tablet! This is also by far the only one with built in DVD writer and 1GB RAM and 80GB HDD and Bluetooth and full 14.1" LCD (most other tablets have just 10").

For [$2300][2], it makes a pretty good developer machine.
