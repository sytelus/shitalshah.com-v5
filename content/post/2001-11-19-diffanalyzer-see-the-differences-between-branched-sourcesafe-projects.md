If you need to maintain several source branches in SourceSafe and constantly retrofitting your code around, this application can be tremendously helpful. It looks in to two specified SourceSafe folders, goes through all the files in them and finds out which files are different and performs various analysis in smarter way so you don't have to actually check diffs manually. This application is in state of easy clicks.
