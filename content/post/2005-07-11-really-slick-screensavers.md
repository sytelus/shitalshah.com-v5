[These][1] are some of the best screensavers I've seen anywhere. Check out especially skyrocket which is extremely cool simulation of fireworks with randomly moving camera in 3D space and also Helios. Too bad I can't use them because I've donated my free computer time to World Community Grid to compute protein folding :(.
