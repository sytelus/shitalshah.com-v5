I just finished [my new article on CodeProject][1]. The mission on MimeTeX was started about couple of months ago when in a weekend I just got attracted to MimeTeX's C code like a magnet ;). Now I've built ASP.Net handler, caching, admin etc on the top of it and its looking great! Enabling scientific content on web seems to be my new obsession. So if you take pride in delighting your users with every new release, here's your brand new feature! Go ahead, download it, use it! If you run in to any problem, I'll be glad to offer you my help.
