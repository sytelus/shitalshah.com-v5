This innocent little puzzle formed from some of the recent code I was writing. Lets see if it gets you!

<pre class="code-block"><code>object p = 2;
object q = p;
p = 4;
System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("Answer is " + q.ToString());
</code></pre>

Meanwhile I'm having fun asking it to my colleagues ðŸ˜‰
