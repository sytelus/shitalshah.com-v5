One of the most wanted feature from users point of view in MS SQL Server is capability to generate INSERT scripts for MS SQL Server data. But call it Microsoft's ignorance, this feature not supplied since quite long. And even worse, there is no public domain application to do that. This feature is usually desperately required in situation like sending test data to somebody or supply sample data. So I decided to write my own. It's still isn't the perfect and can't handle all of the possibilities but it could be your best bet with supplied source code! This application is right now in state of easy installation but no on-line help is available.
