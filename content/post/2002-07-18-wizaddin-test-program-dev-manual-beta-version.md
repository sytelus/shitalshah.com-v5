This is complete rewrite of WizAddIn and much more organized code but less tested. However you get nice document on how to use it and a test demo program too. 

<p class="obsolete">
  Warning: This program was written circa Jul 2002. It is currently considered obsolete. There are no plans to update it and no support is provided.

[WizAddIn is now archived at Github][2]
