Before I go to bed, few more bits... This is to announce that this year's [VMA][1] sucked. I used to see this show for it being totally different from other award functions (i.e. freaky, weird, explicit and eye-popping). It seems to be the general opinion that if it hadn't been for [Britney-Madonna's kiss][2], this would have been the worse so far.
