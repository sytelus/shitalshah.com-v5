BNL certainly has some scientific lyrics. The "Pavlov's dog" mentioned in [Brian Wilson][1] is about the classic experiment conducted by Pavlov in 1900s to show that dogs can learn to associate ringing of bell to the arrival of food and keep salivate even if you stop giving food.

On another note, "Nine-point-eight straight down" in [When I Fall][2] is the Earth's gravitational constant _g_ when an object freely falls.

There aren't possibly better ways writing about science experiments in more artistic ways in mainstream songs ðŸ˜‰
