[This Task Manager][1] for Windows rocks. Besides doing everything that you ever wanted from a thing called Task Manager (even showing open files for every process), it has one of the sweetest option that your application should provide: Replace Windows native [equivalent thing]! I just keep wishing if there had been free and with-source Calculators and Explorers and everything else Windows that I can just replace with a click like this and move on rather then [waiting for a decade][2] on Microsoft to improve their [age old featureless][3] apps. So when you are getting [cool skinable Windows][4]? In [next 3 years][5]? Yeah, right.
