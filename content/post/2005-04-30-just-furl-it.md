[Furl][1] totally rocks. It's almost everything I needed from a bookmarking services. Beats [Delicious][2] any day. But I guess being usable is one thing and popular quite another.

  * Furl supports FireFox and IE.
  * One click to bookmark a website.
  * It has a killer feature that most websites miss: An ability for users to provide feedback in almost every corner!
  * You can export your bookmarks out of their system (so you are not locked down with them)
  * You can import your existing bookmarks in to Furl. However they don't tag them using existing folder structure :(.
  * You can [Publish RSS for your bookmarks][3] 
  * You can create a setup so Furl [automatically sends out email][4] of your newly added bookmarks to your mailing list or something. 
  * Furl saves a copy of page along with bookmark, in case that website goes down :).
  * You can search not just by title of bookmark but also by content of pages in your bookmarks.
  * Gives you recommendations from what you bookmarked so far.

However it's not ideal. There are few tricks and tips you need to know. To start with, I disabled their default list of topics, set it up for multiple topics mode by default and choose a dummy instead last used topic as a default for new bookmarks. After this, I can now use furl like just delicious but with much better interface. Just click on Furl bookmarklet, enter list of tags separated ";" in New Topic box and there you go! I guess they could have made things much easier by making it simple: just two text boxes url and tags 

Anyhow,

You can view [my collection of bookmarks][5] there.
  
Subscribe to [RSS feed for my links][6] as I add them.
  
[Join my Yahoo group][7] to receive links I discover in email. 

I'm not bookmarking in my browser any longer. That feels like so yesterday...
