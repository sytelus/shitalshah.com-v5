Past weekend, I finally thought about giving Twitter a try and started looking for a client app that just allows me to very quickly update the status with a global keyboard shot cut. I'm not in to following anyone or replying anyone but wanted this very simple app with one text box. Apparently no such apps existed in Twitter Fan Wiki which actually turned out to be a good thing because I immediately started looking at Twitter's API and any C# wrappers. About 90 minutes later I'd my app ready. On the way I also added functionality to break the big updates in to multiple twits. This little (literally) app is now open sourced on CodePlex and ready for you to [try it out][2]!
