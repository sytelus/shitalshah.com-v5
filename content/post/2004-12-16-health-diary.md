This is an ASP.Net based sample website created for Highland Tech Highschool, AK. I like to show it as more of a demo for my SyFastPage framework. Nothing fancy here except that it was literally created overnight and it justifies "fast" in the name SyFastPage. I'd initially decided to give a try to CodeCharge studio and automatically generate pages in about 5 hours that I'd i my hand but results weren't professional and customizable as we wanted. So I dig up my old code in SyFastPage and put it to work. It also proved the point that I often make: Code generation sucks, reusable libraries rules.
