The individuals in population and their interaction with each other very closely models neural activities in brain. The entire neural network can be looked upon as smaller fractal version of human population, with lot of details vanished. It occurs to me that an alien might prefer to look upon Earth as the planet hosting one huge "brain" with individual humans essentially just forming "cells" for this brain.
