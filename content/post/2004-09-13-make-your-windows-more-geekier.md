[X-Setup][1] is perhaps the most comprehensive Windows tweaking utility. I always end up spending half a day enabling all the hidden advanced settings using this thing. Fortunately it provides Recording mode and creation of a REG file. This is really cool because now with just a click I can make any XP/2003 machine more geekier and end lots of "default" annoyances. If you are interested you too can use my [final REG file][2]. It would enable a whole range of features â€“ everything from showing additional control panel applets, using double pans in explorer, removing Outlook attachment restrictions, showing file attributes in tooltip, adding new items in Explorer context menu, removing Shutdown Reason UI, kill everything quickly when shutting down and so on...
