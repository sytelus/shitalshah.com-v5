This is a really engaging book. It will take you to the journey of just few microseconds after the big bang, the sequence of events for next few minutes and how everything came to existance. It's not baseless as it may sound, there is tons of mathematics behind every conclusion. Even more engaging is the discussion why we should bother about this? The book is slim and probably the best in astrophysics ever written for a layman! [More on this book...][2]
